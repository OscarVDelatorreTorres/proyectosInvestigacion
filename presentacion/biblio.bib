	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the present paper, we test the benefit of using Markov-Switching models and volatility futures diversification in a Euro-based stock portfolio. With weekly data of the Eurostoxx 50 (ESTOXX50) stock index, we forecasted the smoothed regime-specific probabilities at T + 1 and used them as the weighting method of a diversified portfolio in ESTOXX50 and ESTOSS50 volatility index (VSTOXX) futures. With the estimated smoothed probabilities from 9 July 2009 to 29 September 2020, we simulated the performance of three theoretical investors who paid different trading costs and invested in ESTOXX50 during calm periods (low volatility regime) or VSTOXX futures and the three-month German treasury bills in distressed or highly distressed periods (high and extreme volatility regimes). Our results suggest that diversification benefits hold in the short-term, but if a given investor manages a two-asset portfolio with ESTOXX50 and our simulated portfolios, the stock portfolio’s performance is enhanced significantly, in the long term, with the presence of trading costs. These results are of use to practitioners for algorithmic and active trading applications in ESTOXX50 ETFs and VSTOXX futures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper examines regime switching behaviour and dynamic linkages among currency and equity markets of Eurozone, India, Japan and U.S. using a Markov-switching framework. First, we seek to characterize the market specific and common regime shifts in international stock and currency markets. Second, we aim to study regime-dependent conditional correlations across these markets. We estimate state-dependent models for the financial markets in a univariate Markov-switching Autoregression (MS-AR) as well as a multivariate Markov-switching Vector Autoregression (MS-VAR) framework. The paper utilizes weekly data from July, 1999 to October, 2020 to model the interactions among the markets. Our univariate results identify two-states viz. bull state (bear state) characterized by high returns (low returns) and low volatility (high volatility) for the stock market indices and Euro/USD and INR/USD returns. For the Yen/USD market the bull state corresponds to depreciation accompanied by low volatility. Further, we employ a multivariate formulation to study the regimes across asset classes which provides additional insights into the common states across the markets. Using the MS-VAR model encompassing stocks and currencies, we find a tranquil regime characterized by lower volatility and higher returns and a turbulent regime depicted by higher volatility and lower returns. Contemporaneous correlations among asset market pairs are sharper during the crises. Some of the turbulent periods highlighted in the analysis include the dot-com bubble burst, South American crisis, 9/11, Iraq war, housing bubble burst, global financial crisis, Eurozone debt crisis, Taper Tantrum, Brexit, U.S. Federal Government Shutdown, U.S.-China Trade War and the recent COVID-19 pandemic.},

We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a financial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns.},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) is becoming very important in the last two decades as a strategy that can contribute to the company and to build a more equitable and sustainable overall future financial performance. However, in what has to do with the financial performance, so far, the results obtained by the doctrine have been mixed. This paper analyzes the impact on the financial performance of Mexican listed companies that have earned the distinction of socially responsible companies. The results obtained show that there is a positive relationship between financial performance and obtaining such distinction as shown in financial variables like ROE and ROA, earnings per share (UPA) and the price ratio between books (P/VL) value. Evidence found provides some recommendations for Mexican companies and policy-makers in this field. Introducción Tras los primeros diez años del siglo XXI parece ampliamente aceptado que la creación de valor se debe producir no sólo para el accionista, sino también para el resto de los partícipes y agentes sociales, según la función que cumpla cada uno (Bueno-Campos, 2004). Este planteamiento se conoce en la literatura como el enfoque de los stakehol-ders, superado el enfoque financiero clásico de los shareholders. Milton Friedman (1962) encarna el enfoque shareholder que se resume en dos principios: 1) el único público al que la empresa debe rendir cuentas es a sus accionistas; 2) el único ob-jetivo que debe buscar la empresa es la maximización del beneficio o valor de la empresa. Por el contrario, el enfoque stakeholder engloba a la totalidad de grupos que tienen interés en la empresa que ésta tiene que equilibrar en su propio bene-ficio (Freeman, 1994). Estos grupos estarían constituidos por los accionistas, los empleados, los proveedores tanto de capital financiero como de bienes y servicios, el estado y la sociedad en su conjunto (Alonso-Almeida, 2007). Por tanto, se puede decir que la empresa es un nexo de contratos implícitos basados en la confianza y la reputación que intenta equilibrar todos los intereses involucrados en ella, tanto externos como internos (},

In order to accomplish this goal, different statistical models were employed to add robustness to the results Some of the statistical models employed were univariate tests and panel data models. Our results indicate that there is a positive relationship between CSR activities and the financial performance of the company. Due to the time restriction, it is not possible to suggest that this relationship is maintained in the long term, but only in the short and medium terms.

If we give up such a thesis we find there is no stakeholder theory but that stakeholder theory becomes a genre that is quite rich. It becomes one of many ways to blend together the central concepts of business with those of ethics. Rather than take each concept of business singly or the whole of “business” together and hold it to the light of ethical standards, we can use the stakeholder concept to create more fine-grained analyses that combine business and ethics; or more simply, we can tell many more, and more interesting, stories about business.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The dire economic situation in Mexico, with its high rate of unemployment, makes it necessary for many women to find some form of economic activity to provide income for their families. Although such conditions could encourage the creation of new firms, the results of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2006 Report show a gap between the number of women involved in nascent and young entrepreneurship initiatives and the number who owns established firms. This gap may indicate that the firms created need to improve their competitiveness and their ability to survive. The model proposed adopts the resource‐based view of the firm as a theoretical framework from which to study how entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and learning orientation, as well as the interactions between them, influence the achievement of competitive advantage and superior performance in businesses owned by women. Our investigation analyzes businesses established and managed by women in Mexico and registered with the Asociación Mexicana de Mujeres Empresarias A.C. (Mexican Association of Business Women) and the Red de Empresarias del Instituto Nacional de Mujeres (Women Entrepreneurs Network of the National Women's Institute). To gather the information needed, the study used a questionnaire as a measuring instrument. The results are based on the 90 complete answers received from the questionnaires distributed. The results show that all of relationships in our model are positive except the hypothesis that learning orientation mediates in the relationship between market orientation and performance. The results suggest that entrepreneurial orientation reinforces the effect of two capabilities, market orientation and learning orientation, on firm performance. They also reaffirm that the three capabilities assessed may lead an organization to differentiate itself from its competitors by improving its performance. In addition to contributing to the literature on female entrepreneurship, the results have important implications for management. Understanding the relationships between capabilities and the performance of women‐owned businesses in Mexico can permit the identification of areas for improvement to promote the growth and survival of this type of firm.},

This research is based on a comparative descriptive analysis of the public information provided by the most representative ESG rating and information provider agencies in the financial market in two periods: 2008 and 2018. The findings show that ESG rating agencies have integrated new criteria into their assessment models to measure corporate performance more accurately and robustly in order to respond to new global challenges.

Some of the basic findings are the following: (1) For the regression coefficients, the computationally simple ANOVA methods perform reasonably well when compared with the computationally involved MLE and MIVQUE methods. (2) MLE and MIVQUE perform better than the ANOVA methods in the estimation of the individual variance component, especially for severely unbalanced patterns and large variance component ratio. However, for the remainder variance component, there is nothing much to choose among these methods. (3) Better estimates of the variance components do not necessarily imply better estimates of the regression coefficients. (4) Making the data balanced, by dropping observations, worsens the performance of these estimators when compared to those from the entire unbalanced data.},

We studied the 40 companies of the FTSE-MIB index for 3 years 2016–2018. Using yearly regression analysis, pooled analysis, and differential analysis, we find that the female involvement on both boards has almost no significant effect on the financial performance; however, a significant association is found with the corporate sustainability performance. The robustness checks using differential analysis confirm the later relationship in which firms that improved female representation had also an ethical score upgrade. Interestingly, we also provide that there is an optimal level of gender quotas that maximizes sustainability performance and beyond that, a negative impact on performance might be detected.},

Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon and the higher their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. Overall, our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important as a tool for additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers.},

We find no sufficient evidence for ESG factors to complement FF5.

The argument that corporate managers should replace their singular focus on shareholders with a broader vision, where they also serve other stakeholders, including customers, employees and society, has found a receptive audience with corporate CEOs and institutional investors. The pitch that companies should focus on "doing good" is sweetened with the promise that it will also be good for their bottom line and for shareholders. In this paper, we build a framework for value that will allow us to examine how being socially responsible can manifest in the tangible ingredients of value and look at the evidence for whether being socially responsible is creating value for companies and for investors.},

The resource-based view of the firm and stakeholder theory are used as the theoretical foundation of the study. The hypotheses of the study are tested via fixed-effects regression using data for a sample of 1,234 firms and 5,102 firm-year observations for the period 2009–2013. The study finds evidence that CSR performance and financial performance are positively related, and the magnitude of this relationship is contingent on the level of board diversity. As corporate boardrooms become more diverse across several diversity attributes, the positive effect of CSR performance on financial performance becomes more profound. The study also reveals that race and age diversity constructs have a stand-alone moderating effect on this purported relationship. The study offers significant insights for practitioners regarding the potential role of a diverse board structure in effectively monitoring management actions on CSR concerns.},

We examine the activist’s target selection, forms of engagement, impact on ESG performance, drivers of success, and effects on the targets’ operations and value creation. Target firms are typically large and visible, perform well, and have high liquidity (stock turnover) and low ESG performance. Engagement induces ESG rating adjustments: firms with poor ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings increase after complying with the activist’s demands, whereas firms with high ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings decrease following the revelation of their ESG problems. Activism that is focused on environmental and social issues is more likely to succeed if targets are ESG-sensitive (i.e., they have a strong ex ante ESG profile). Successful engagements boost targets’ sales. Risk-adjusted excess stock returns (with four-factor adjustment and relative to a matched sample of non-engaged firms) of successful engagements outperform those of unsuccessful engagements by 2.7\%. Results are especially strong for firms with low ex ante ESG scores. Specifically, targeted firms in the lowest ex ante ESG quartile outperform matched peers by 7.5\% in the year after the end of the engagement. Our results thus suggest that the activism regarding corporate social responsibility generally improves ESG practices and corporate sales and is profitable to the activist. Taken together, we provide direct evidence that ethical investing and strong financial performance, both from the activist’s and the targeted firm’s perspective, can go hand-in-hand together.},

Multiply by the Number of Employees for the current year, for which we are calculating as estimated CO2 number. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 with Net Sales (in USD) instead of Number of Employees. 5.

	abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance and diversification value of water-related funds. As pollution, climate change and accelerated population growth threaten water resources worldwide, such resources have become a sought-after asset. For most investors, it is impractical to physically hold water as part of a portfolio; therefore, an open question is how to better gain exposure to this asset. The authors propose a look at water-related mutual funds, an issue not found addressed in the literature. In addition to the investment potential of these funds, investors might be drawn to them as part of a more comprehensive socially responsible agenda. Design/methodology/approach-In the present study, the authors identify and measure the risk-adjusted performance and diversification value of open-end funds dedicated to investments in water-related securities. Jensen's alpha is used to measure risk-adjusted performance, whereas diversification value is examined by implementing a methodology widely used in the mutual fund literature. Findings-Consistent with previous studies on the performance of ethical or socially responsible mutual funds, the authors found that their sample of water-related mutual funds neither outperform nor underperform two benchmarks. However, the authors also found that they offer potential diversification gains for international mutual funds' portfolios. Research limitations/implications-Open-end water-related mutual funds have only been recently created, and currently, very few funds are available to investors. These facts limit the sample size and the length of the return series examined. Originality/value-The authors have not found a paper that examines the performance and diversification value of water-related mutual funds. These funds present themselves as a practical way for individual investors to gain exposure to the commodity of water.},

We find a non-linear relationship between ESG activity and bank value. Our results indicate low levels of ESG activity positively impact bank value. However, there are diminishing returns to scale. Environmentally friendly activities have the greatest effect on bank value. We examine the channels through which ESG activity impacts bank value and find a positive relationship between ESG activity and both cash flows and efficiency. We find ESG activity negatively affects the cost of equity but has no effect on the cost of debt. Our results explain why proponents of both stakeholder theory and trade-off theory have found evidence to support their predictions of the relationship between ESG activity and bank value.},

Es un enfoque que, según la literatura científica, está muy presente en las sociedades cooperativas y es fuente de singularidades de éstas. En este sentido la Comisión Europea (2002) indicó que "Las cooperativas tienen una larga tradición en combinar viabilidad económica y responsabilidad social gracias al diálogo entre las partes interesadas y a la gestión participativa, y pueden servir de referencia a otras organizaciones". Este trabajo tiene como objetivo poner de manifiesto que la responsabilidad social corporativa está entroncada en los valores y principios cooperativos y que, por tanto, constituye una ideología innata al cooperativismo.

Findings from descriptive analysis show that board diversity tends to be higher with banks endowed with low financial leverage and high assets. Cross-country analysis shows that Central America evinces the highest levels of board diversity among banks. In Europe, however, repose the highest levels of environmental and social disclosure among banks. In contrast, the highest level of governance disclosure among banks obtains in Australia. A regression model partially corroborates the gender board diversity as a causal factor of the corporate governance disclosure inasmuch as, when female board members account for 22–50\% of the board, a positive significant effect on the level of ESG disclosure results. However, at levels above 50\%, negative returns to scale manifest on ESG disclosure from female board participation. Given the effect on the latter on the former uncovered by this research, regulators ought to mandate quotas of female participation on bank boards to engender sustainable increases in the level of ESG reporting on the part of banks.},

The resource-based view of the firm and stakeholder theory are used as the theoretical foundation of the study. The hypotheses of the study are tested via fixed-effects regression using data for a sample of 1,234 firms and 5,102 firm-year observations for the period 2009–2013. The study finds evidence that CSR performance and financial performance are positively related, and the magnitude of this relationship is contingent on the level of board diversity. As corporate boardrooms become more diverse across several diversity attributes, the positive effect of CSR performance on financial performance becomes more profound. The study also reveals that race and age diversity constructs have a stand-alone moderating effect on this purported relationship. The study offers significant insights for practitioners regarding the potential role of a diverse board structure in effectively monitoring management actions on CSR concerns.},

	abstract = {In this research, we empirically investigate the impact of the board's female representation on corporate financial and sustainability performance after the introduction of the minimum gender quotas in Italy in 2011 (Golfo-Mosca Law). We studied the 40 companies of the FTSE-MIB index for 3 years 2016–2018. Using yearly regression analysis, pooled analysis, and differential analysis, we find that the female involvement on both boards has almost no significant effect on the financial performance; however, a significant association is found with the corporate sustainability performance. The robustness checks using differential analysis confirm the later relationship in which firms that improved female representation had also an ethical score upgrade. Interestingly, we also provide that there is an optimal level of gender quotas that maximizes sustainability performance and beyond that, a negative impact on performance might be detected.},

However, research articles focus not only on the socioecological aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) but also on the underlying effects on a corporation\&rsquo;s corporate financial performance (CFP). In this regard, the current study aims to analyze the impact of ESG parameters on corporations\&rsquo; financial stability. A sample size of 691 companies in North American countries was investigated in order to test the hypothesis that ESG has an effect on the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using the Ohlson O-score. This is conducted using regression models and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, a follow-up hypothesis on the relationship between firm size and ESG is also tested in order to evaluate a tendency of corporate growth through ESG-based sustainable development. The results of the study conclude that the governing pillar of ESG factors has the highest positive impact on corporations\&rsquo; financial success. Furthermore, the analysis conducted in the study with its sample size confirms the hypothesis that larger firms tend to have higher ESG scores.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a renewed interest in value creation for stakeholders has been witnessed in different contexts. Different tools have been proposed to try to grasp and measure such value(s) but, in many cases, the main perspective remains that of the shareholders. To contribute to the field of research that aims to discuss novel ways of thinking about value creation measurement, this paper addresses the relationship between ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings and Value Added, as proxies of value creation and distribution for stakeholders. In particular, we consider whether ESG ratings are able to capture companies that are characterized by their capacity for generating higher Value Added for stakeholders. Our analysis uses the frontier methodology combined with means comparison. Data from 2018 were downloaded from EIKON, for all companies within the Euro zone and for all sectors (1932 companies, of which 399 held an ESG rating, compared with 1533 without ESG analysis). Our analysis reveals that, although ESG is theoretically considered a good social responsibility proxy, ESG indices cannot be used as an indicator of value creation for stakeholders but, rather, must be considered as only one of the components. This implies a need to review the limitations of ESG ratings and establish that the relevant indices are not suitable for use in universal or absolute decision-making.},

	abstract = {Much work in finance is devoted to identifying characteristics of firms, such as measures of fundamentals and beliefs, that explain differences in asset prices and expected returns. We develop a framework to quantitatively trace the connection between valuations, expected returns, and characteristics back to institutional investors and households. We use it to analyze (i) what information is important to investors in forming their demand beyond prices and (ii) what is the relative importance of different investors—differentiated by type, size, and active share—in the price formation process. We first show that a small set of characteristics explains the majority of variation in a panel of firm-level valuation ratios across countries. We then estimate an asset demand system using investor-level holdings data, allowing for flexible substitution patterns within and across countries. We find that hedge funds and small, active investment advisors are most influential per dollar of assets under management, while long-term investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies are least influential. In terms of pricing characteristics, small, active investment advisors are most important for the pricing of payout policy, cash flows, and the fraction of sales sold abroad. Large, passive investment advisors are most influential in pricing the Lerner index, a measure of markups, and hedge funds for the CAPM beta},

	abstract = {We study behind-the-scenes investor activism promoting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) improvements by means of a proprietary dataset of a large international, socially responsible activist fund. We examine the activist’s target selection, forms of engagement, impact on ESG performance, drivers of success, and effects on the targets’ operations and value creation. Target firms are typically large and visible, perform well, and have high liquidity (stock turnover) and low ESG performance. Engagement induces ESG rating adjustments: firms with poor ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings increase after complying with the activist’s demands, whereas firms with high ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings decrease following the revelation of their ESG problems. Activism that is focused on environmental and social issues is more likely to succeed if targets are ESG-sensitive (i.e., they have a strong ex ante ESG profile). Successful engagements boost targets’ sales. Risk-adjusted excess stock returns (with four-factor adjustment and relative to a matched sample of non-engaged firms) of successful engagements outperform those of unsuccessful engagements by 2.7\%. Results are especially strong for firms with low ex ante ESG scores. Specifically, targeted firms in the lowest ex ante ESG quartile outperform matched peers by 7.5\% in the year after the end of the engagement. Our results thus suggest that the activism regarding corporate social responsibility generally improves ESG practices and corporate sales and is profitable to the activist. Taken together, we provide direct evidence that ethical investing and strong financial performance, both from the activist’s and the targeted firm’s perspective, can go hand-in-hand together.},

	abstract = {Markowitz (1952, 1959) underlies modern corporate finance literature, from modern portfolio theory, option theory, to risk management (especially value at risk type methodologies). From it, Diversify has entered all languages, such is its power. Terms such as “the only free lunch” have become a way to give praise to Markowitz work. And, just as with all fundamental breakthroughs in the literature it has been extended many directions, sometimes not necessarily to the benefit of the original work, which often gets blamed when one rendition or another breaks down. With almost every MBA graduated believing they know what Markowitz optimization or portfolio theory means, it behooves us to step back and look at some of the basics, the assumptions that are made, the costs of breaking assumptions, and the potential disasters that can occur when those basics behind all of the theories dependent upon Markowitz' original work are ignored. This paper lays out many of the basic underlying assumptions behind creation of Markowitz type portfolios, why they matter, and where those assumptions are ignored and/or broken. Breaking model assumptions is common in actual application of theory. Not understanding the implications of broken assumptions is almost a guarantee of failure for a money manager; it is just a matter of time. As one often hears, “Wall Street (or the City if in Europe) is littered with great ideas that do not work in practice.” Some people throw Markowitz and portfolio optimization into that litter bin. We discuss several basic assumptions of modern portfolio theory, when and why they are commonly broken by the best of us in academia and in practice, and discuss the implications for breaking them under trying circumstances.},

Notably, the GIA’s return-forecasting power is not subsumed by publicly available quantitative predictors, such as momentum, value, and earnings quality, nor is it subsumed by methods shown in past research to forecast stock returns using fund holdings or trades.

	abstract = {Since the subprime crisis, portfolios based on risk diversification are of great interest to both academic researchers and market practitioners. They have also been employed by several asset management firms and their performance appears promising. Since they do not rely on estimates of expected returns, they are assumed to be robust. The same argument holds for minimum variance and equally weighted portfolios. In this paper,we consider aMonteCarlo simulation, as well as an empirical global portfolio dataset, to study the effect of estimation errors on the outcomes of two recently proposed asset allocations, the equally weighted risk contribution (ERC) and the principal component analysis (PCA) portfolio. The ERC portfolio is more robust to changes in the input parameters and has a smaller estimation error than the Markowitz approaches, whereas the PCA portfolio is even more unstable than the classical approaches. In the worst-case scenario, neither approach delivers what it promises. However, in every case the resulting return–risk relationship is dominated by the Markowitz approaches},

We identify (1) risk torsion induced by the flip rate for risk averse and risk seeking behaviour, and (2) a structure constant or coupling of that torsion in the paracompact man- ifold. The risk torsion operator extends by continuity to prudence and maxmin expected utility (MEU) operators, as well as other behavioural operators introduced by the Italian school. In our erstwhile chaotic dy- namical system, induced by behavioural rotations of probability domains, the loss aversion index is an unobserved gauge transformation; and ref- erence points are hyperbolic on the utility hypersurface characterized by the special unitary group SU(n). We identify conditions for existence of harmonic utility functions on paracompact MTK manifolds induced by transformation groups. And we use those mathematical objects to esti- mate: (1) loss aversion index from infinitesimal tangent vectors; and (2) value function from a classic Dirichlet problem for first exit time of Brow- nian motion from regular points on the boundary of MTK base topology.},

	abstract = {In this work we find the optimal trading strategy to sell (or buy) a large position K of a given asset S by a fixed time T . In order to do so, we assume that the price process S is modelled as a geometric Wiener process, instead of the arithmetic approach used in the current literature. Furthermore, the impact due to the trade affects geometrically the price process S. The criteria of optimality is Markowitz's mean-variance and the method of ap-proximating the solution is through a multiperiod binomial model. Alternatively, using our model we study the effect of transacting a large position β of a financial derivative with underlying S. We show, for instance, that if a corporation covers a large position on a given asset with vanilla European put options, the price of the underlying will decrease by the trade. In turn, the price of the contract will increase. Finally, using our model, we find statistical evidence that the volume traded of a derivative is correlated to price movements in the underlying.},

	abstract = {There exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: the "Q" area of derivatives pricing, whose task is to "extrapolate the present"; and the "P" area of quantitative risk and portfolio management, whose task is to "model the future". We briefly trace the history of these two branches of quantitative finance, highlighting their different goals and challenges. Then we provide an overview of their areas of intersection: the notion of risk premium; the stochastic processes used, often under different names and assumptions in the Q andinthe P world; the numerical methods utilized to simulate those processes; hedging; and sta- tistical arbitrage},

	abstract = {We introduce the copula-marginal algorithm (CMA), a commercially viable technique to generate and manipulate a much wider variety of copulas than those commonly used by practitioners. CMA consists of two steps: separation, to decompose arbitrary joint distributions into their copula and marginals; and combination, to glue arbitrary copulas and marginals into new joint distributions. Unlike traditional copula techniques, CMA a) is not restricted to few parametric copulas such as elliptical or Archimedean; b) never requires the explicit computation of marginal cdf’s or quantile functions; c) does not assume equal probabilities for all the scenarios, and thus allows for advanced techniques such as importance sampling or entropy pooling; d) allows for arbitrary transformations of copulas. Furthermore, the implementation of CMA is also computationally very efficient in arbitrary large dimensions. To illustrate benefits and applications of CMA, we propose two case studies: stress-testing with a panic copula which hits non-symmetrically the downside and displays non-equal, risk-premium adjusted probabilities; and arbitrary rotations of the panic copula.},

El cálculo de medición fue utilizando el modelo de portafolio eficiente de Markowitz. Se encontró que la inversión extranjera puede conllevar a bajos rendimientos comparado con las inversiones locales, debido a la actual revaluación de la moneda. Además, los resultados obtenidos a través del cálculo de la frontera eficiente muestran que aquellos puntos que se refieren a la ley 100, al fondo conservador, al fondo moderado y al fondo agresivo, están por debajo de la frontera, lo que significa que los rendimientos de los Multifondos no son los mejores a pesar de todas las modificaciones hechas en la ley 1328 de 2009. Por último, las FPO deben tomar en cuenta todas las recomendaciones de política hechas por la OCDE, especialmente la asignación estratégica y táctica de activos, debido a que los resultados que se encontraron son poco consistentes.},

However, these assertions may be valid for hte Mexican AFORE, who are banned from investing in equities and foreign securities.

Two most important stylized facts of such series are volatility clustering, and non-normality as a result of fat tails of the return distribution. While volatility clustering has been extensively studied using the GARCH model and its various extensions, the phenomenon of non-normality has not been comprehensively explored, at least in the context of VaR estimation. A combination of extreme value theory (EVT) and GARCH has been explored to analyze financial data showing non-normal behavior. This paper proposes a combination of the Pearson’s Type IV distribution and the GARCH (1,1) approach to furnish a new method with superior predictive abilities. The approach is back tested for the entire sample as well as for a holdout sample using rolling windows.},

The study draws on evidence from four countries that have fully privatized their public pension schemes (Chile, Mexico, Bolivia, and El Salvador) and four that have partially privatized (Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru). Some evidence suggests that privatization is having positive economic effects, contributing to the development of financial institutions and the availability of investment capital. It may also be increasing national savings rates and the rates of economic growth, but on these issues there is less agreement. The benefits of privatization go primarily to high-wage male workers with few benefits for low-wage and female workers.},

	title = {The {Lee}–{Carter} method of forecasting mortality, with various extensions and applications},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {In 1992, Lee and Carter published a new method for long-run forecasts of the level and age pattern of mortality, based on a combination of statistical time series methods and a simple approach to dealing with the age distribution of mortality. The method describes the log of a time series of age-specific death rates as the sum of an age-specific component that is inde- pendent of time and another component that is the product of a time-varying parameter reflect- ing the general level of mortality, and an age-specific component that represents how rapidly or slowly mortality at each age varies when the general level of mortality changes. This model is fit to historical data. The resulting estimate of the time-varying parameter is then modeled and forecast as a stochastic time series using standard methods. From this forecast of the general level of mortality, the actual age-specific rates are derived using the estimated age effects. The forecasts of the various life table functions have probability distributions, so probability intervals can be calculated for each variable and for summary measures such as life expectancy. The projected gain in life expectancy from 1989 to 1997 matches the actual gain very closely and is nearly twice the gain projected by the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Actuary. This paper describes the basic Lee-Carter method and discusses the forecasts to which it has led. It then discusses extensions, applications, and methodological improvements that have been made in recent years; considers shortcomings of the method; and briefly describes how it has been used as a component of more general stochastic population projections and stochastic forecasts of the finances of the U.S. Social Security system.},

Normally distributed assets are the setting for the theoretical and empirical analyses. The results agree well with the available theory and imply utility functions and parameter values that are appropriate for investors with particular risk-bearing attitudes. The results give strong empirical support to the proposition that utility functions having different functional forms and parameter values but "similar" absolute risk aversion indices have "similar" optimal portfolios. These results suggest that over horizons up to one year one can safely substitute "convenient" surrogate utility functions for other utility functions, for reasons of tractability or otherwise. The results also provide guidance regarding the significance of the magnitude and change of particular numerical values of the risk aversion index. Moreover, theoretical ("exact") results are obtained using Rubinstein's measure of global risk aversion.},

Micro-longevity risk quantifies the risk related to uncertainty in the time of death if survival probabilities are known with certainty, while macro-longevity risk is due to uncertain future survival probabilities. We use a generalized two-factor Lee–Carter mortality model to produce forecasts of future mortality rates, and to assess the relative importance of micro- and macro-longevity risk for funding ratio uncertainty. The results show that if financial market risk is fully hedged so that uncertainty in future lifetime is the only source of uncertainty, pension funds are exposed to a substantial amount of risk. Systematic and non-systematic deviations from expected survival imply that, depending on the size of the portfolio, buffers that reduce the probability of underfunding to 2.5\% at a 5-year horizon have to be of the order of magnitude of 7\% to 8\% of the initial value of the liabilities.},

Based on these benchmarks, “Characteristic Timing” and “Characteristic Selectivity” measures are developed that detect, respectively, whether portfolio managers successfully time their portfolio weightings on these characteristics and whether managers can select stocks that outperform the average stock having the same characteristics. We apply these measures to a new database of mutual fund holdings covering over 2500 equity funds from 1975 to 1994.

Using a vector autoregression for returns, liabilities and macro-economic state variables the paper explores the intertemporal covariance structure of assets and liabilities. We find horizon effects in time diversification, risk diversification, inflation hedge and real interest rate qualities. The covariance structure gives insights into which asset classes have a term structure of risk that is different from that of stocks and bonds. The alternative assets classes add value for long-term investors. Differences in strategic portfolios for asset-only and asset–liability investors are due to differences in the global minimum variance and liability hedge portfolio. We find that the benefits of long-term investing are larger when there are liabilities.},

	abstract = {Traditional portfolio optimization has often been criticized for not taking estimation risk into account. Estimation risk is mainly driven by the parameter uncertainty regarding the expected asset returns rather than their variances and covariances. The global minimum variance portfolio has been advocated by many authors as an appropriate alternative to the tangential portfolio. This is because there are no expectations which have to be estimated and thus the impact of estimation errors can be substantially reduced. However, in many practical situations an investor is not willing to choose the global minimum variance portfolio but he wants to minimize the variance of the portfolio return under specific constraints for the portfolio weights. Such a portfolio is called local minimum variance portfolio. Small-sample hypothesis tests for global and local minimum variance portfolios are derived and the exact distributions of the estimated portfolio weights are calculated in the present work. The first two moments of the estimator for the expected portfolio returns are also provided and the presented instruments are illustrated by an empirical study},

This article analyzes the existing literature to see whether the recommendation of holding cap-weighted indices is indeed grounded in financial theory. Although the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) theory does lead to a recommendation to hold the market portfolio, the model’s practical relevance is limited by its unrealistic assumptions. If we relax those assumptions, theory does not predict that the market portfolio is efficient. In addition, the CAPM also fails in empirical tests, showing that it is not the true asset pricing model. Even if the CAPM were the true model, and the market portfolio was efficient, a stock market index is a very poor proxy for the market portfolio, because it includes only a fraction of the economy-wide wealth. Thus, from a theoretical perspective, cap-weighted stock market indices seem to have no particular appeal.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {A number of quantitative or fundamental weighting schemes have been shown to produce robust outperformance with respect to standard cap-weighted equity indices over long time periods. Over periods ranging from a few months to a few years, however, such alternative weighting schemes can generate substantial downside risk relative to cap-weighted indices, which would be a source of concern for most investment managers or chief investment officers. In this article, the authors focus on two reasonable proxies for well-diversified, efficient frontier portfolios, namely, the maximum Sharpe ratio (MSR) portfolio and the global minimum volatility (GMV) portfolio. They address the question of how to use these building blocks to design an improved equity benchmark while satisfying target levels of average and extreme tracking error with respect to cap-weighted indices. The authors find that robust proxies for the GMV portfolio provide defensive exposure to equity that does well in adverse market conditions, while robust proxies for MSR portfolios provide greater access to the upside of equity markets. Because the relative performance of these two diversification approaches depends on market conditions, they expect a combination of both approaches to lead to a smoother conditional performance and higher probability of outperformance of the cap-weighted index, an intuition that is confirmed in empirical tests. Empirical analysis also suggests that “diversifying the diversifiers” still leads to high levels of relative downside risk, in particular when the performance of cap-weighted indices is unusually strong. In this context, the authors introduce an explicit relative risk control mechanism designed to reduce the consequences of severe short-term underperformance with respect to the cap-weighted index and confirm through out-of-sample empirical tests that “tracking the tracking error” would allow investors to achieve better access to outperformance per unit of extreme relative risk taken. Overall, the results reported in this article suggest that it is possible to achieve robust outperformance versus cap-weighted indices by diversifying model risk and by controlling relative risk compared to the cap-weighted indices.},

In this paper, we analyze the performance of Fundamental IndexingTM (“FI”). First, we show that the source of FI’s recent excellent performance is not from its ability to systematically arbitrage mispricing in a noisy market but from increasing the portfolio’s exposure to stocks with low price-to-book values and with small capitalizations. We find that FI does not produce a positive alpha when its excess returns are explained by the Fama-French three-factor model of CAPM beta, the value premium and the size premium. Second, we show that it is possible to construct a portfolio of exchange-traded funds with similar factor loadings that can replicate, and sometimes, even outperform FI. However, we caution investors not to expect consistent outperformance from portfolios tilted towards value and small-cap stocks. Historical data shows evidence of mean reversion in the performance of such strategies.},

This article demonstrates that, except in trivial cases, this assumption is internally inconsistent because the sources of the “errors” are also determinants of market values. The article shows under what conditions fundamental weights are better—or worse—estimators of fair value weights than are market value weights, thereby demonstrating that the new theory is merely a conjecture. A formula is developed for the value bias inherent in fundamental weighting, and two approaches to combining fundamental and market values are discussed.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {This article examines the impact of participants’ age distribution on the asset allocation of Dutch pension funds, using a unique data set of pension fund investment plans for 2007. Theory predicts a negative effect of age on (strategic) equity exposures.We observe that a 1-year higher average age in active participants leads to a significant and robust reduction of the strategic equity exposure by around 0.5 percentage point. Larger pension funds show a stronger age-equity exposure effect. The average age of active participants influences investment behavior more strongly than the average age of all participants, which is plausible as retirees no longer possess any human capital.

	abstract = {One common misperception about global markets is that there is something fundamentally "wrong" with one market trading at several times the price/earnings multiple of another. But there is nothing in equilibrium theory to suggest that P/E differences between markets represent investment opportunities. The appropriate strategy for exploring global asset allocation is not to compare the valuation in one country directly with the valuation in another. Rather, one should compare the earnings yield in one country with the cash or bond yield in the same country, thereby arriving at a measure of the equity risk premium in that country. Deviations from the "normal" equity risk premiums can then be compared across country boundaries. As economic and political risks differe across countries, so should equity risk premiums. Changes in the relative risk premium between two equity markets can, however, provide a measure of changes in relative valuation and, potentially, of changes in the relative attractiveness of the two markets. This suggests a framework for global asset allocation that allows for comparisons both within and between countries. In essence, such a framework would enable one to compare Japanese stocks with German bonds or with U.S. cash.},

Its power function is derived and used to study the sensitivity of the test to the portfolio choice and to the number of assets used to determine the ex post mean-variance efficient frontier. Several intuitive interpretations of the test are provided, including a simple mean-stan- dard deviation geometric explanation. A univariate test, equivalent to our multivariate-based method, is derived, and it suggests some useful diagnostic tools which may explain why the null hypothesis is rejected. Empirical examples suggest that the multivariate approach can lead to more appropriate conclusions than those based on traditional inference which relies on a set of dependent univariate statistics},

	abstract = {The sustainability of US external debt, which has been an issue of global concern, is analyzed using a Markov switching (MS) unit root test applied to the flow of debt, i.e., the current account. The first to apply the MS unit root test to the issue of US external debt in order to examine local stationarity and global stationarity were Raybaudi et al. (2004). This paper introduces an extended MS unit root test where the transition probability is time-varying rather than fixed, as is usually the case, and the change of probability is explained by the real exchange rate, which theory suggests has a close relationship with the external balance. The extended MS unit root test calculated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method provides us with new insights on the issue of US external debt in recent years, suggesting that even though the debt/current account–GDP ratio remains relatively high, the probability of stationarity (sustainability) is unexpectedly high when recent US dollar depreciation is taken into account.},

	abstract = {Efficient simulation techniques for Bayesian inference on Markov-switching (MS) GARCH models are developed. Different multi-move sampling techniques for Markov switching state space models are discussed with particular attention to MS-GARCH models. The multi-move sampling strategy is based on the Forward Filtering Backward Sampling (FFBS) approach applied to auxiliary MS-GARCH models. A unified framework for MS-GARCH approximation is developed and this not only encompasses the considered specifications, but provides an avenue to generate new variants of MS-GARCH auxiliary models. The use of multi-point samplers, such as the multiple-try Metropolis and the multiple-trial metropolized independent sampler, in combination with FFBS, is considered in order to reduce the correlation between successive iterates and to avoid getting trapped by local modes of the target distribution. Antithetic sampling within the FFBS is also suggested to further improve the sampler’s efficiency. The simulation study indicates that the multi-point and multi-move strategies can be more efficient than other MCMC schemes, especially when the MS-GARCH is not strongly persistent. Finally, an empirical application to financial data shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed estimation procedure.},

	abstract = {We examine the investment skill of socially responsible investment (SRI) fund managers. Prior studies use the ‘alpha’ from standard asset pricing models as a proxy for management skill. However, implicit in the use of such models is that managers operate under no investment constraints. In the SRI context, this is patently false and can lead to biased alpha estimates and false conclusions about the existence of skill. We introduce a novel three-factor Fama–French asset-pricing model with the aim of estimating alpha more accurately and hence investment skill, without bias. This model excludes SRI-prohibited industries such as defense, alcohol, tobacco and gambling in the construction of the Fama–French market, value and size risk factors. We show that the exclusion of the SRI-prohibited industries leads to subtle and complex changes to the risk factors that drive SRI returns. When we re-estimate alpha using the new model we find, in contrast to the conventional Fama–French model, evidence of statistically and economically significant alpha. Furthermore, the risk loadings on the new risk factors are similar to those of the original Fama–French model suggesting that changes in risk loadings are not responsible for the finding of significant skill.},

Estimating this path dependent model is a challenging task because exact computation of the likelihood is infeasible in practice. This difficulty led to estimation procedures either based on a simplification of the model or not dependent on the likelihood. There is no method available to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator without resorting to a modification of the model. A novel approach is developed based on both the Monte Carlo expectation–maximization algorithm and importance sampling to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator and asymptotic variance–covariance matrix of the Markov-switching GARCH model. Practical implementation of the proposed algorithm is discussed and its effectiveness is demonstrated in simulation and empirical studies.},

It is conjectured that structural changes contribute to non-normality in stock return distributions. SWARCH models, which admit parameters based on various states to control structural changes in the estimating periods, may thus help mitigate kurtosis, tail-fatness and skewness problems in estimating VaR. Significant kurtosis and skewness in return distributions of Dow Jones, Nikkei, FCI and FTSE and significant tail-fatness (tail- thinness) in the 1\% (5\%) region critical probability are documented. Moreover, it is shown that the more generalized SWARCH outshines both ARCH and GARCH in capturing non-normalities with respect to both in- and out-sample VaR violation rate tests.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {This paper explores the effect of exclusionary ethical investing on corporate behavior in a risk-averse, equilibrium setting. While arguments exist that ethical investing can influence a firm's cost of capital, and so affect investment, no equilibrium model has been presented to do so. We show that exclusionary ethical investing leads to polluting firms being held by fewer investors since green investors eschew polluting firms' stock. This lack of risk sharing among non-green investors leads to lower stock prices for polluting firms, thus raising their cost of capital. If the higher cost of capital more than overcomes a cost of reforming (i.e., a polluting firm cleaning up its activities), then polluting firms will become socially responsible because of exclusionary ethical investing. A key determinant of the incentive for polluting firms to reform is the fraction of funds controlled by green investors. In our model, empirically reasonable parameter estimates indicate that more than 20\% green investors are required to induce any polluting firms to reform. Existing empirical evidence indicates that at most 10\% of funds are invested by green investors.},

Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey \& Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples},

Regardless of the choice of benchmark portfolio or estimation model, the average selectivity measure is positive and the average timing measure is negative. However both selectivity and timing appear to be somewhat sensitive to the choice of a benchmark when managers are classified by investment style. Meta-analysis revealed some real variation around the mean values for each measure. The 80 percent probability intervals for selectivity revealed that the best managers produced substantial risk-adjusted excess returns. We also found a negative correlation between selectiv- ity and timing, but we argue that the observed negative correlation in our data is largely an artifact of negatively correlated sampling errors for the two estimates.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors. related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates. the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important. the five factors seem to explain average returns on stock and bonds.},

Here we present the framework used by the Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index (DJSGI) for identifying and ranking companies according to their corporate sustainability performance. In a yearly review the 10\% leading sustainability companies in each of the 64 industry groups are selected for inclusion in the DJSGI. Throughout the year the companies are continuously monitored and, if necessary, downrated or excluded from the Index. A variety of sources is used for the assessment and for cross-checking of information, including company questionnaires, company documents, publicly available information, stakeholder relations, media screening and company interviews. The selection process is externally verified and the methodology is reviewed yearly to capture the increasing knowledge and standardisation of sustainability issues and to align it with ongoing initiatives such as the Global Reporting Initiative.},

understanding of such strategies and provides a simple framework to
compare them. All except the equal-weighted strategy are defensive and
have lower volatility than the market-cap index. Equal-weighted is
exposed to small-cap stocks. Equal-risk budget and equal-risk
contribution are exposed to small-cap and to low-beta stocks.These three
have a high correlation of excess returns, and their portfolios largely
overlap.Their portfolios invest in all stocks available and have both a
low turnover and low tracking error relative to the market-cap index.
The minimum variance and maximum diversification strategies primarily
have exposure to low-beta stocks.These two strategies are the most
defensive, invest in much the same stocks, and have high tracking error
and turnover.},

based on four different covariance matrix estimators, using daily return

ante minimum-variance portfolios is a recommendable way to achieve
efficient portfolios in accordance with Markowitz's mean-variance
optimization, the authors benchmark the four portfolios' performance
against the German stock index DAX, which also determines the investable
universe. This is the first study that uses not only historical
volatility and covariance data, but also implied volatilities from the
stock options market to estimate the covariance matrix. The article also
analyzes how results change when the shrinkage method, suggested by
Ledoit and Wolf in a 2003 article published in this journal, is applied
to both the historical and the implied volatility estimators. The
authors demonstrate that all minimum-variance portfolios outperform the
DAX index. The implied-volatility estimator, modified by the shrinkage
method, offered the best results in terms of volatility, return, and
efficiency ratio. In contrast to previous empirical results, applying
the shrinkage method to the historical sample covariance matrix yields
little benefit, if any. However, applying the shrinkage method to the
implied-volatility estimator significantly improves the quality of the
covariance estimation, resulting in improved performance from the
minimum-variance portfolio.},

	abstract = {Disappointed with the performance of market weighted benchmark portfolios yet skeptical about the merits of active portfolio management, investors in recent years turned to alternative index definitions. Minimum variance investing is one of these popular concepts. I show in this paper that the portfolio construction process behind minimum variance investing implicitly picks up risk-based pricing anomalies. In other words theminimum variance tends to hold low beta and low residual risk stocks. Long/short portfolios based on these characteristics have been associated in the empirical literature with risk adjusted outperformance. This paper shows that 83\% of the variation of the minimum variance portfolio excess returns (relative to a capitalization weighted alternative) can be attributed to the FAMA/FRENCH factors as well as to the returns on two characteristic anomaly portfolios. All regression coefficients (factor exposures) are highly significant, stable over the estimation period and correspond remarkably well with our economic intuition. The paper also shows that a direct combination of market weighted benchmark portfolio and risk based characteristic portfolios will provide a statistically significant improvement over the indirect pickup via the minimum variance portfolio.},

Further, we observe that our portfolio strategy achieves higher Sharpe ratios than 1/N, amounting to an average Sharpe ratio increase of 32.5\% across our six empirical datasets. We find that our constrained minimum- variance strategy is the only strategy that achieves the goal of improving the Sharpe ratio of 1/N consis- tently and significantly.

It contributes to the literature on asset pricing, as well as to the literature that examines how sustainability impacts capital markets, by constructing a new factor that captures differences in the returns of sustainable and non-sustainable firms. Specifically, it examines whether an additional sustainability factor has explanatory power in asset pricing models that include size, book-to-market equity, and momentum factors. This research has practical implications for the performance measurement of portfolios and mutual funds that are managed in accordance with sustainability criteria in that it disentangles general stock-picking skills from the differences in returns between sustainable and non-sustainable stocks.},

Unless the underlying stochastic process is Gaussian, the lack of serial correlation does not imply statistical independence. However, many empirical studies of stock price behavior have made the stronger assumption of intertemporally independent returns. Before any probability distribution model is fitted to data, the underlying assumptions of the model have to be verified empirically. Almost all of the popular models of stock returns require that returns be independent random variables and many also require that they be identically distributed. The presence of linear dependence in daily return series of market indexes can be attributed to various market phenomena and anomalies. The presence of a common market factor and the speed of information processing by market participants and day-of-the-week effects could contribute partially to autocorrelations.},

	abstract = {Even the best investors seem to find it hard to do better than the comprehensive common-stock averages, or better on the average than random selection among stocks of comparable variability. Examination of historical samples of percentage changes in a stock's price show that, when these relative price changes are properly adjusted for expected dividends paid out, they are more or less indistinguishable from white noise; or, at the least, their expected percentage movements constitute a driftless random walk (or a random walk with mean drift specifiable in terms of an interest factor appropriate to the stock's variability or riskiness). The present contribution shows that such observable patterns can be deduced rigorously from a model which hypothesizes that a stock's present price is set at the expected discounted value of its future dividends, where the future dividends are supposed to be random variables generated according to any general (but known) stochastic process. This fundamental theorem follows by an easy superposition applied to the 1965 Samuelson theorem that properly anticipated futures prices fluctuate randomly--i.e., constitute a martingale sequence, or a generalized martingale with specifiable mean drift. Examples demonstrate that even when the economy is not dree to wander randomly, intelligence speculation is able to whiten the spectrum of observed stock-price changes. A subset of investors might have better information or modes of analysis and get above average gains in the random-walk model; and the model's underlying probabilities could be shaped by fundamentalsists' economic forces.},

Second, they specify intermediate-frequency dynamics usually assigned to smooth autoregressive transitions. Finally, high-frequency switches generate substantial outliers. Thus a single mechanism captures three features that are typically viewed as distinct in the literature. Maximum-likelihood estimation is developed and performs well in finite samples. Using exchange rates, we estimate a version of the process with four parameters and more than a thousand states. The multifractal outperforms GARCH, MS-GARCH, and FIGARCH in- and out-of-sample. Considerable gains in forecasting accuracy are obtained at horizons of 10 to 50 days.},

Namely, more than four-fifths of the firms belong to globally integrated sectors. In general, MNCs perform a global (integrated) CR strategy.

This paper is an exploratory study of the obstacles to SRI among individual investors in Spain. Individuals and financial consultants were surveyed about their current investment strategies, their preferences as regards criteria and ethical strategies, and the perceived obstacles for the development of SRI. The findings unveil the factors leading to the limited development of the SRI Spanish retail market. The paper offers guidelines that can be used by Spanish financial consultants and foreign fund managers when approaching the Spanish market.

We find a significant relationship between diversity in boards and social performance. This relationship is moderated by diversity of boards. Our results also reveal the effects of the specific variables that make up the diversity of boards and diversity in boards constructs. In particular, gender, and age have a significant effect on corporate social performance. Some important measurement issues are raised and discussed.},

Results indicate that, given the level of profitability, the variable that most affects the generation of sustainable value is corporate governance (G), followed by environmental (E) and social (S) practices. The main limitation of the study is the sample size. The originality of this paper lies in the fact that it determines corporate efficiency using financial performance as an input of a DEA model and sustainable value ratings as outputs. Conclusions show that corporate social responsibility activities may enhance firms’ sustainable efficiency. Therefore, it is proposed that corporate efficiency might be complemented by sustainable value measurements.},

We extended the current literature in two ways: first, we estimated the smoothed probabilities of being in ‘normal’ ( s = 1 ), ‘distress’ ( s = 2 ) and ‘crisis’ ( s = 3 ) episodes in the Refinitiv global leisure and recreation index. Then, we estimated the influence that the VIX and uncertainty indexes had on the generation of distress and crisis episodes in these stocks. By using logit regressions, we found out that only the US Economic policy uncertainty index is a detonator of distress and crisis episodes. We also found that the pandemic (COVID-19) news uncertainty has no significant and direct influence on the smoothed probabilities. Finally, and complementary to the current literature, we found that the volatility spillover effect from the S\&P 500 to these stocks generates extreme volatility (crisis) episodes. Our results could be of use for practitioners and scholars and could provide a model to forecast distress and crisis episodes among leisure and recreation stocks. This model could be used for potential portfolio management or economic (tourism) policy purposes.},

	abstract = {In the present study the need of a portfolio management process for dirección de pensiones civiles del Estado de Michoacán (DPCEM), a defined benefit pension plan, in order to attain a 3.5\% or 4.5\% real target return in its technical reserve is observed. As a potential answer, the Markowitz-Tobin-Sharpe-Lintner (MTSL) model is proposed after a review of the modern portfolio theory in the context of the classical financial economics is made. Following, some alternative covariance matrixes that model the volatility and correlation clustering effect were reviewed, noting the proper use in the technical reserve’s portfolio management process of the orthogonal GARCH models or O-GARCH with Gaussian and t-Student log-likelihood functions as one of the particular goals established in the present document. In order to probe that the actuarial target returns were fulfilled and to determine the proper covariance matrix, three discrete event simulations were performed being the only difference among them the covariance matrix used. This was done by approximating the inflows and outflows in the technical reserve in a weekly time period from January 2 nd , 2020 to December 30 th , 2010 and by simulating the execution of the portfolio management process and the MTSL model. The observed results suggest that the actuarial target returns are fulfilled if the O-GARCH covariance matrixes are used and also note that there is no quantitative or statistical criteria that lead to the preference among the Gaussian or the t-Student case, leaving the decision to theoretical considerations related to the nature of the probability density function used. With the observed results, a governance structure and portfolio management process proposal is made in order to implement in the DPCEM the infrastructure needed to fulfill the pension plan main financial goals.

En el presente trabajo se revisa la necesidad de la dirección de pensiones civiles del Estado de Michoacán (DPCEM), como plan de pensiones de beneficio definido, de contar con un proceso de administración de portafolios para lo que se denomina su reserva técnica, mismo que les permita lograr en la misma un nivel de rentabilidad real igual o superior a dos objetivos actuariales del 3.5\% o 4.5\%, siendo entonces el objetivo principal del presente trabajo de investigación determinar que, con el empleo de un proceso de administración de portafolios en la reserva técnica de la dirección de pensiones civiles del Estado de Michoacán (DPCEM), se logra una tasa real de rendimiento igual o superior a dichos objetivos, objetivo que llevó a demostrar como válida la siguiente hipótesis: “Se observan en la reserva técnica de la dirección de pensiones civiles del Estado de Michoacán tasas de rendimiento igual o superiores a sus objetivos actuariales si se emplea en la misma un proceso de administración de portafolios internacionalmente diversificado. Esto en virtud de que el valor base cien de la misma es igual o superior al de un activo teórico que logra los objetivos mencionados.” Para dar fundamento a la demostración de la misma y a la resolución del problema identificado, primero se realizó una revisión de los modelos de la teoría moderna de portafolios en el contexto de la economía financiera clásica, observando y fundamentando el empleo del denominado Markowitz-Tobin-Sharpe-Lintner (MTSL). Posterior a ello, se revisaron formas alternativas de cálculo de las matrices de covarianzas, como insumo del MTSL, que permitiesen modelar el efecto de conglomerado de volatilidades y de correlaciones característico de los activos y mercados financieros.},

The panel data also included the ROE, the market risk (beta) and the stock price return of these companies. The authors estimated the corresponding regressions with the panel data and tested the relationship between the workforce score and these three variables. In a second method, they simulated the weekly performance of a portfolio that invested only in European companies with high standards in their HPWP and compared its performance against a conventional market portfolio (with no HPWP screening). Findings In the first method, the authors found no significant relationship between the workforce score and the ROE, beta, or stock price return in the panel regression, controlling for random effects. In the second one, they found no over or underperformance in the HPWP portfolio against the European market one in the second method. Practical implications The results suggest that there is no risk or cost for European Public companies and investors alike if they promote, with better HPWP, the happiness and well-being of their workforce. The findings suggest that if European companies promote HPWP, there will be no adverse impact on their profits, market risk, or stock price performance. Also, investors will not lose performance (against a conventional market portfolio) if they screen their portfolios with this type of workforce-friendly companies. Originality/value Increase the scarce literature on the test of the workforce score with company profitability (ROE), stock market price variation and stock market risk level.},

The main findings are that Net Operating Margin (MNO) has a direct relationship. Net noninterest Margin (MNNI) and Asset Utilization (RA) have a negative impact on ROA. Regarding access channels, Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) have a positive, albeit weak, impact. Point of Sale Terminals (POS) are significant but in reverse. As for ROE, MNO and MNNI are related in the same sense as ROA. The Capital Multiplier (MC) presents a negative relationship.

With a balanced panel data of 659 European companies from January 2017 to Jun 2021, we found that the WPUI could be used in a regional perspective, along with the VIX and TWITUI factors. In a country-specific perspective, only the inclusion of the TWITUI factor led to better-fitting results in Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden.

Our position was that the B–L optimal portfolios could generate alpha (extra return) against a buy-and-hold and an actively managed portfolio with sample portfolio parameters (à la Markowitz, SampP). Our results suggest that the outperformance of the B–L managed portfolios holds only in the short term. In the long-term, the performance of the B–L portfolios, the SampP, and the market portfolio are statistically equal in terms of returns or their mean–variance efficiency in an ex-ante or ex-post analysis.},

To do this, we first found closed-form solutions of the corresponding utility-maximization problem, which solves a rational consumer that makes portfolio and consumption decisions by using the corresponding infinitesimal generator associated with the Markov chain. Subsequently, as an illustration of the theoretical results obtained, several scenarios were simulated for the Mexican case. The expected economic policy was inferred from announced monetary policy decisions regarding the reference rate and possible changes in trend due to the lack of fiscal stimuli. Under this framework, states were defined from the current and expected economic policies, and transition probabilities were expressed in terms of the ratio between the prices of the risky asset and the bond. It should be noted, as far as the authors know, that no analytical solutions are known in the literature for the case of Markov-modulated time-inhomogeneous chains with transition probabilities that, themselves, are stochastic processes.},

It then employs a Markov switching vector autoregressive model to investigate the regime-dependent responses of the market to its fundamental shocks. The results reveal that the US natural gas market tends to be much more sensitive to shocks occurring in regimes existing after the Decontrol Act 1989 than the other regimes. The paper also finds that shocks to the natural gas demand and price have negligible effects on natural gas production while the price of natural gas is mainly driven by specific demand shocks. Augmenting the model by incorporating the price of crude oil, the results show that the impacts of oil price shocks on natural gas prices are relatively small and regime-dependent.},

Our model links the univariate volatilities with the correlations via a hidden stochastic decision tree. The ensuing Hidden Markov Decision Tree (HMDT) model is in fact an extension of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) introduced by Jordan et al. (1997). The architecture of this model is the opposite that of the classical deterministic approach based on a binary decision tree and, it allows a probabilistic vision of the relationship between univariate volatility and correlation. Our results are categorized into three groups, namely (1) exchange rates and oil, (2) S\&P500 indices, and (3) precious metals. A switching dynamics is seen to characterize the volatilities, while, in the case of the correlations, the series switch from one regime to another, this movement touching a peak during the period of the Subprime crisis in the US, and again during the days following the Tohoku earthquake in Japan. Our findings show that the relationships between volatility and correlation are dependent upon the nature of the series considered, sometimes corresponding to those found in econometric studies, according to which correlation increases in bear markets, at other times differing from them.},

Oil price shocks have been amongst those economic variables that have been identified in theoretical andempirical literature to predict phases ofbusiness cycles. However, the role ofoil price shocks to determine business cycle fluctuations has received less attention in emerging and developing economies. The aim ofthis study is to investigate the role ofoil price shocks in predicting phases ofthe South African business cycle associated with higher and lower growth regimes. By adopting a regimedependent analysis, we investigate the impact ofoil price shocks under two phases ofthe business cycle, namely high and low growth regimes. As a net importer ofoil, South Africa is expected to be vulnerable to oil price shocks irrespective of the phase of the business cycle. Using a Bayesian Markov switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model and data for the period 1960Q2 to 2013Q3, we found the oil price to have predictive content for real output growth under the low growth regime. The results also show the low growth state to be shorter-lived compared to the higher growth state},

On monthly intervals, the price of many commodities produced predominantly in tropical regions covary with the dominant mode of climate variability in this region, namely the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, for the spot prices returns of vegetable oils produced in Asia, we develop autoregressive (AR) models with exogenous ENSO indices, where for the first time these indices are generated by a purpose-built state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) climate forecasting system. The GCM is a numerical simulation which couples together the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice, with the initial conditions tailored to maximize the climate forecast skill at multiyear timescales in the tropics. To serve as additional benchmarks, we also test commodity forecasts using: (a) no ENSO information as a lower bound; (b) perfect future ENSO knowledge as a reference upper bound; and (c) an econometric AR model of ENSO. All models adopting ENSO factors outperform those that do not, indicating the value here of incorporating climate knowledge into investment decision-making. Commodity forecasts adopting perfect ENSO factors have statistically significant skill out to 2 years. When adopting the GCM-ENSO factors, there is predictive power of the commodity beyond 1 year in the best case, which consistently outperforms commodity forecasts adopting an AR econometric model of ENSO.},

Trading activity as a factor for agricultural futures price volatility has been studied extensively since the emerge of commodity index traders followed by commodity markets becoming more volatile in the last decade. However, the majority of research papers investigate major cereal future contracts whereas the research on dairy futures is not yet analyzed. The aim of this review is to present the current situation in the research of dairy futures trading activity effect on their price volatility, focusing on methodological progress and related issues. This review provides a comparative analysis of empirical research articles on dairy futures price volatility and its determinants published in 2005 and later. Dairy futures markets compared to other agricultural commodity markets were less liquid and more fragmented, however, they likewise experienced a significant price volatility and seasonality during observed time periods. High price volatility was especially present in cash settled butter futures. Even though there is an indication among selected studies that trading activity correlate with price volatility, this should be supplemented by an analysis of causal relationships. Therefore, a further research on dairy futures should provide necessary tools to measure the exact effect of trading activity on price volatility in order to provide better insights on using dairy futures as an effective means for managing price risk in dairy sector.},

It is shown that under these assumptions, commodity prices are driven by both market fundamentals and noise trader positions. Further, noise trader effects spill over to the cash market if limits to arbitrage due to transaction costs are imperfect but are confined to the futures market otherwise.

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of trading volume and open interest on volatility of futures markets. The authors capture the size and change in speculative behaviour in futures markets by examining the role of liquidity variables (trading volume and open interest) in the behaviour of futures prices. Design/methodology/approach The sample includes daily data covering the period 1996-2014 from 36 international futures markets (including currencies, commodities, stock indices, interest rates and bonds). The authors employ a two-stage estimation methodology: first, the authors employ a E-GARCH model and consider the asymmetric response of volatility to shocks of different sign. Further, the authors consider a regression framework to examine the contemporaneous relationships between volatility, trading volume and open interest. To quantify the percentage of volatility that is caused by liquidity variables, the authors also regress the estimated volatilities on the measures of open interest and trading volume. Findings The authors find that: market depth has an effect on the volatility of futures markets but the direction of this effect depends on the type of contract, and there is evidence of a positive contemporaneous relationship between trading volume and futures volatility for all futures contracts. Impulse-response functions also show that trading volume has a more relevant role in explaining market volatility than open interest. Practical implications These results are recommended to financial managers and analysts dealing with futures markets. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has yet considered a complete database of futures markets to investigate the empirical relation between price changes (volatility), trading volume and open interest in futures markets.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The authors' paper aims to deal with the question whether speculative bubbles are present in agricultural commodity prices. Design/methodology/approach – The authors apply a regime switching regression model to test the hypothesis that agricultural prices contain periodically collapsing bubbles. Using daily futures prices for six agricultural commodities, the authors calculate net convenience yields from which price fundamentals are derived. Findings – The authors discover pronounced deviations between observed prices and their fundamental values. However, they do not find evidence for the presence of periodically and partially collapsing speculative bubbles for five of six commodities. Except for soybeans, the signs and the significance of the estimated coefficients are not entirely in line with the predictions of the theoretical model. Originality/value – The authors' study adds to the heated discussion on the impact of speculative behavior on agricultural commodity prices. So far, most contributions in the literature either use theoretical arguments for the (non‐) existence of bubbles or apply indirect tests which are plagued by low statistical reliability. In contrast, the authors apply a direct test. They find that the outcome of empirical bubble tests depends on the considered bubble type and on the testing procedure. In view of these ambiguities, definite statements on the presence of speculative bubbles as well as demands for limitations of speculative positions in commodity futures markets should be carefully reconsidered.},

A regime-switching model is proposed to describe the time evolution of market prices. In this model, the base regime is described by a meanreverting diffusion process and the second regime is driven by the predictions of a deep neural network trained on the market log-returns time series. A statistical technique, based on the method of simulated moments, is proposed to estimate the model on market data. We applied this methodology to energy commodity price time series with very different characteristics, namely the US wholesale electricity, natural gas and crude oil price daily time series. The obtained results show a good agreement with empirical data. In particular, the model seems to reproduce in a very interesting way the first four central moments of the empirical distributions of log-returns as well as the shape of the observed price time series.},

These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

Funded pensions, which were among the first institutions to respond to sustainability concerns, are showing renewed interest in better ways to reflect responsible investing objectives, along with regulators, asset managers and shareholder groups. Looking back, the principal elements of sustainability—environmental, social and governance (ESG)—all have different origins and took different pathways. Looking across, sustainable investing developed differently depending on region and country. Viewing it today, we see the trend toward E, S, \& G convergence—of definition, process and organization—toward a more integrated investment perspective and process. With growing asset size, funded pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other large institutional investors became ‘universal owners’ and, along with thought leaders and regulators, drove the evolution of sustainable investing toward the more systematic set of tools and policies we see today. Looking forward, questions remain, such as who will be most influential in determining the future of sustainable investing—pensions and other institutional investors, governments, shareholders and companies-- as well as what it will look like. As such, sustainability remains a work in progress and pensions are in a strong position to shape its evolution.},

Based on in-depth interviews with the organizations? founders and historical document analysis, we recap the history of the cases and show how different origins, philosophies, and ?purposes? of ESG issues shaped the methods and data characteristics of two of the most important data vendors of their time. We discuss why MSCI chose to continue with the financial value?oriented methodology of Innovest while discontinuing the values-driven KLD methodology. Through an in-depth literature analysis, we further show that not only the creation but also the use of ?nonfinancial performance? concepts rely on processes of social construction. We also show that investors use different ESG data from those used by academics, potentially leading to misaligned narratives. Finally, with this article we join the call for more explicit contextualization of ESG data, highlighting that both practitioners and academics need to better understand the social construction that underlies analyses that use different concepts of ESG.},

Several studies have shown how rating agencies and data vendors display very little agreement on how to construct and use ESG measures. While commending these findings, we argue that only studying how data diverges is missing the insights of a more substantial question about the why of this divergence. Taking a lens of “social construction”, we thus set out to explore the differences between ESG measures as a function of (a) data vendors’ diverse social origins and (b) their necessity to create a unique profile in a maturing market. Examining five cases of eight interconnected ESG data vendors and rating agencies, we thus show how the origin of each company (their founding principles, legal status, purpose, etc.) strongly influences its conception of sustainability, definition of materiality, and by extension, the way ESG issues are measured and sold. We find that data vendors can be characterized into groups of value-vs values-based organizations, and that dynamics of consolidation on the ESG market and the mainstreaming of ESG data use are linked to a shift from values-to value-driven investors in the ESG space. Finally, the paper highlights pathways into a new ESG research agenda which explores the impact of the here examined origins of metrics.},

It is mainly intended for Data Scientists and Software Engineers who are involved in the development of Advanced Analytics applications. To understand this book, it would be useful if you have basic knowledge of probability theory and analytics and some familiarity with the programming language R. What You Will Learn * Set up the R environment * Create a classification model to predict and explore discrete variables * Get acquainted with Probability Theory to analyze random events * Build Linear Regression models * Use Bayesian networks to infer the probability distribution of decision variables in a problem * Model a problem using Bayesian Linear Regression approach with the R package BLR * Use Bayesian Logistic Regression model to classify numerical data * Perform Bayesian Inference on massively large data sets using the MapReduce programs in R and Cloud computing In Detail Bayesian Inference provides a unified framework to deal with all sorts of uncertainties when learning patterns form data using machine learning models and use it for predicting future observations. However, learning and implementing Bayesian models is not easy for data science practitioners due to the level of mathematical treatment involved. Also, applying Bayesian methods to real-world problems requires high computational resources. With the recent advances in computation and several open sources packages available in R, Bayesian modeling has become more feasible to use for practical applications today. Therefore, it would be advantageous for all data scientists and engineers to understand Bayesian methods and apply them in their projects to achieve better results.

It is mainly intended for Data Scientists and Software Engineers who are involved in the development of Advanced Analytics applications. To understand this book, it would be useful if you have basic knowledge of probability theory and analytics and some familiarity with the programming language R. What You Will Learn * Set up the R environment * Create a classification model to predict and explore discrete variables * Get acquainted with Probability Theory to analyze random events * Build Linear Regression models * Use Bayesian networks to infer the probability distribution of decision variables in a problem * Model a problem using Bayesian Linear Regression approach with the R package BLR * Use Bayesian Logistic Regression model to classify numerical data * Perform Bayesian Inference on massively large data sets using the MapReduce programs in R and Cloud computing In Detail Bayesian Inference provides a unified framework to deal with all sorts of uncertainties when learning patterns form data using machine learning models and use it for predicting future observations. However, learning and implementing Bayesian models is not easy for data science practitioners due to the level of mathematical treatment involved. Also, applying Bayesian methods to real-world problems requires high computational resources. With the recent advances in computation and several open sources packages available in R, Bayesian modeling has become more feasible to use for practical applications today. Therefore, it would be advantageous for all data scientists and engineers to understand Bayesian methods and apply them in their projects to achieve better results.

IDBA overcomes the weaknesses of DBA as it embraces an original order size management and risk management modules. We examine the performance of IDBA in the forex market. The results suggest that IDBA can provide significantly greater returns than DBA. The results also show that the IDBA outperforms another DC-based trading strategy and that it can generate annualized returns of about 30\% after deducting the bid and ask spread (but not the transaction costs).},

In this article, we examine the problem in the foreign exchange (FX) market, and we use an agent-based market simulation to examine which trading strategies lead to market states in which the stylized facts (statistical properties) of the simulation match those of the FX market transactions data. Our goal is to explore the emergence of the stylized facts, when the simulated market is populated with agents using different strategies: a variation of the zero intelligence with a constraint strategy, the zero-intelligence directional-change event strategy, and a genetic programming-based strategy. A series of experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with those of a high-frequency FX transaction data set. Our results show that the zero-intelligence directional-change event agents best reproduce and explain the properties observed in the FX market transactions data. Our study suggests that the observed stylized facts could be the result of introducing a threshold that triggers the agents to respond to periodic patterns in the price time series. The results can be used to develop decision support systems for the FX market.},

Directional Changes (DC) is an approach to summarize market prices other than time series. DC marks the market as downtrend or uptrend based on the magnitude of prices changes. In this paper we address the problem of forecasting trend's direction in the foreign exchange (FX) market under the DC framework. In particularly we aim to answer the question of whether the current trend will continue for a specific percentage before the trend ends. We propose one single independent variable to make the forecast. We assess the accuracy of our approach using three currency pairs in the FX market; namely EUR/CHF, GBP/CHF, and USD/JPY. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed forecasting model is very good; in some cases, forecasting accuracy was over 80\%. However, under particular settings the accuracy may not outperform dummy prediction. The results confirm that directional changes are predictable, and the identified independent variable is useful for forecasting under the DC framework.},

Instead of sampling at fixed intervals, DC is data driven: price changes dictate when a price is recorded. DC provides us with a complementary way to extract information from data. It allows us to observe features that may not be recognized in time series. The argument is that time series and DC-based analysis complement each other. With data sampled at irregular time intervals in DC, however, some of the time series indicators cannot be used in DC-based analysis. For example, returns must be time adjusted and volatility must be amended accordingly. A major objective of this paper is to introduce indicators for profiling markets under DC. We analyse empirical high-frequency data on major equities traded on the UK stock market, and through DC profiling extract information complementary to features observed through time series profiling.},

In the present paper we introduce some new concepts associated to data recognition and extend the use of these techniques to econophysics to explore the variations of stock market indicators showing that information theory can help to recognize different regimes. Modifications and further developments to previously introduced data compressor wlzip are introduced yielding two measurements. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that allows to tune the number of significant digits over which the data compression is due to act complementing, this with an appropriate method to round off the truncation. The application is done to IPSA, the main indicator of the Chilean Stock Market during the year 2010 due to availability of quality data and also to consider a rare effect: the earthquake of the 27th of February on that year which is as of now the sixth strongest earthquake ever recorded by instruments (8.8 Richter scale) according to United States Geological Survey. Along the year 2010 different regimes are recognized. Calm days show larger compression than agitated days allowing for classification and recognition. Then the focus turns onto selected days showing that it is possible to recognize different regimes with the data of the last hour (60 entries) allowing to determine actions in a safer way. The “day of the week” effect is weakly present but “the hour of the day” effect is clearly present; its causes and implications are discussed. This effect also establishes the influence of Asian, European and American stock markets over the smaller Chilean Stock Market. Then dynamical studies are conducted intended to search a system that can help to realize in real time about sudden variations of the market; it is found that information theory can be really helpful in this respect.},

The empirical findings reveal that the regime-switching combination forecasts of excess returns deliver consistent out-of-sample forecasting gains relative to the historical average and the Rapach et al. (2010) combination forecasts. The findings also reveal that two regimes are related to the business cycle. Based on the business cycle explanation of regimes, excess returns are found to be more predictable during economic contractions than during expansions. Finally, return forecasts are related to the real economy, thus providing insights on the economic sources of return predictability.},

The main conclusion will be that the data seem to present consistent and strong support for the model. This implies, of course, that chart reading, though perhaps an interesting pastime, is of no real value to the stock market investor. This is an extreme statement and the chart reader is certainly free to take exception. Since the empirical evidence produced by this and other studies in support of the random-walk model is now so voluminous, the counterarguments of the chart reader will be completely lacking in force if they are not equally well supported by empirical work. By contrast the stock market trader has a much more practical criterion for judging what constitutes important dependence in successive price changes. For his purposes the random walk model is valid as long, as knowledge of the past behavior of the series of price changes cannot be used to increase expected gains. More specifically, the independence assumption is an adequate description of reality as long as the actual degree of dependence in the series of price changes is not sufficient to allow the past history of the series to be used to predict the future in a way, which makes expected profits greater than they would be under a naive buy-and-hold model.},

By assuming sparse error covariance matrix in an approximate factor model, we allow for the presence of some cross-sectional correlation even after taking out common but unobservable factors. We introduce the Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) method to explore such an approximate factor structure with sparsity. The POET estimator includes the sample covariance matrix, the factor-based covariance matrix (Fan, Fan, and Lv, 2008), the thresholding estimator (Bickel and Levina, 2008) and the adaptive thresholding estimator (Cai and Liu, 2011) as specific examples. We provide mathematical insights when the factor analysis is approximately the same as the principal component analysis for high-dimensional data. The rates of convergence of the sparse residual covariance matrix and the conditional sparse covariance matrix are studied under various norms. It is shown that the impact of estimating the unknown factors vanishes as the dimensionality increases. The uniform rates of convergence for the unobserved factors and their factor loadings are derived. The asymptotic results are also verified by extensive simulation studies. Finally, a real data application on portfolio allocation is presented.},

Our findings suggest that unstable funding is the main factor driving systemic risk. Furthermore, the combination of significant trading activities with global presence appears to exacerbate spillover risks to the global financial system. Interestingly, whereas trading activities contribute to the build-up of correlated or ‘wrong-way’ risk they help to mitigate individual solvency risk. Conversely, a decentralized approach to liquidity management seems to alleviate individual solvency risk but amplifies the transmission of financial distress across the financial system. This suggests that a macro-prudential approach to financial regulation should focus not only on scaling up micro-prudential measures but also on enabling the efficient transfer of risk between financial institutions.},

In contrast to the previous literature, we discard balance sheet variables and instead develop two indices that revolve solely around income statement and dividend measures. We find that these indices outperformed the FTSE 100 by 3\% on an annual basis over the last 25years, whilst delivering similar or lower volatility. The constructed indices overlap by 90\% with the FTSE 100, in terms of their total market capitalisation and constituent members. They have positive and significant alphas in 3- and 4-factor performance attribution models, showing that the performance cannot be explained by value, size, market beta or momentum tilts alone.},

A rolling window analysis is used to construct out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts of dynamic conditional correlations and optimal hedge ratios. In most of the situations we study, oil is the best asset to hedge emerging market stock prices. Hedge ratios from the ADCC model are preferred (most effective) for hedging emerging market stock prices with oil, VIX, or bonds. Hedge ratios estimated from the GO-GARCH are most effective for hedging emerging market stock prices with gold in some instances. These results are reasonably robust to choice of model refits, forecast length and distributional assumptions.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  \&  Francis Group. This paper proposes new models for analyzing the volatility and dependence of monthly tourist arrivals to China applying a copula-GARCH approach. A desegregation of the top six origins of China inbound tourists from the period January 1994 to December 2013 is used in this study. The empirical results show that there is a strong seasonal effect in all cases and ​​​​​​ some habit persistence on monthly tourist arrival growth rate for South Korea, Russia, the United States (US), and Malaysia. Second, the volatilities of arrival growth rates to China are impacted significantly by their own short- and long-run effects, except for Russia and South Korea. Only short-run shock affects Russian arrivals while only long-run shocks are affecting South Korea arrivals. Third, the conditional dependence among different source countries is found to be positive and significant, but the conditional dependence for all considered pairs is low. Moreover, there is extreme co-movement (tail dependence) between the six major tourism source countries, suggesting the pairwise of international tourist arrivals shows a related increasing or decreasing pattern during extreme events. Implications are discussed and recommendations provided.},

A major issue for portfolio managers of liability driven institutions is that no benchmark is given to them, although they face mid-term objectives with short term constraints. No performance attribution methodology may then be used to serve as a reference. Assessing the performance of the asset manager as an agent, represents a major stake for the institution as a principal delegating a mandate of asset management. We propose an optimal asset allocation approach taking into account liability constraints to build a benchmark. This benchmark will be used to compare the ex-post effective performance of the asset manager to the effective performance of the ex-ante optimal dynamic asset allocation.},

We find evidence that pension funds exert market discipline on unconnected banks but not on connected ones. On balance, pension funds undermine market discipline in the banking system as a result of conflicts of interest. We conclude that regulations aimed at averting these conflicts can enhance market discipline.},

Political bias is positively related to the percentage of politically-affiliated trustees on the board and Congressional connections. The more politically-affiliated trustees on the board, the more the fund shifts toward risky asset allocations. Overall, our results imply that political bias is likely costly to taxpayers and pension beneficiaries.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This article, which explores how and why the Gaussian copula family developed in the way it did, employs the concept of evaluation culture', a set of practices, preferences and beliefs concerning how to determine the economic value of financial instruments that is shared by members of multiple organizations. We identify an evaluation culture, dominant within the derivatives departments of investment banks, which we call the culture of no-arbitrage modelling', and explore its relation to the development of Gaussian copula models. The article suggests that two themes from the science and technology studies literature on models (modelling as impure' bricolage, and modelling as articulating with heterogeneous objectives and constraints) help elucidate the history of Gaussian copula models in finance.},

We propose a different framework that quantifies the cost of a rebalancing strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns net of transaction costs. We then develop an optimal rebalancing strategy that actively seeks to minimize that cost. We use certainty equivalents and the transaction costs associated with a policy to define a cost-to-go function, and we minimize this expected cost-to-go using dynamic programming. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional rebalancing strategies like monthly, quarterly, annual, and 5\% tolerance rebalancing. We also show the robustness of our method to model error by performing sensitivity analyses.},

Specifically, it examines whether an additional sustainability factor has explanatory power in asset pricing models that include size, book-to-market equity, and momentum factors. This research has practical implications for the perfor- mance measurement of portfolios and mutual funds that are managed in accordance with sustainability criteria in that it disentangles general stock-picking skills from the differences in returns between sustainable and non-sustainable stocks.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the Argentine default of December 2001 on daily spreads on sovereign bonds issued by 10 emerging countries located in Latin America and Asia. It addresses the problem of shift contagion examining the dynamics of variances and covariances obtained with conditional procedures. The intra-regional analysis detects signs of contagion in Latin America, where the default has long-lasting effects. In Asia, changes in spread covariation due to Argentine and other extra area shocks tend to be less persistent. The conditional covariances between Asia and Latin America reflect this state of affairs: they are positive and large only during the turbulent months following September 11 2001 and corroborate the hypothesis of a temporary contagious reaction of the Asiatic spreads to the Argentine default. The blurred vision of the idiosyncratic nature of emerging market bonds is short-lived, and so is the ensuing herding behaviour. A policy of diversification with assets from different geographical areas may thus reduce portfolio risk, in terms of overall variance, in spite of cross-area contagion.},

This combination of features is achieved by assuming that we can decompose the Markov chain that describes regime dynamics into a number of two-state component chains that evolve independently through time. Using daily data for S\&P 500 index and IBM shares, we show that our component-driven regime-switching (CDRS) models are capable of outperforming GARCH, component GARCH, regime-switching GARCH, and Markov-switching multifractal models in forecasting realized variances out of sample.

	abstract = {The pension funding difficulties of the early 2000s highlighted the need for pension plan sponsors to adopt a different approach to investing plan assets in search of greater control over pension funding risk. Plan sponsors should do away with an asset-centric approach and substitute a liability-relative approach, controlling what really matters to the health of the plan (i.e., the net of the assets and the liabilities, the deficit or surplus). Because the liability can be hedged only with market-related (beta) risk, plan sponsors should segregate their beta and alpha decisions. In addition to hedging the liability, the beta decision seeks to balance the growth of the plan surplus against the risk to the surplus. The alpha decision, which is conditional on a plan sponsor’s skill at picking skilled managers, is used to seek alpha, or excess returns over the beta benchmark},

	abstract = {We describe the maximum-likelihood parameter estimation problem and how the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used for its solution. We first describe the abstract form of the EM algorithm as it is often given in the literature. We then develop the EM pa-rameter estimation procedure for two applications: 1) finding the parameters of a mixture of Gaussian densities, and 2) finding the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM) (i.e., the Baum-Welch algorithm) for both discrete and Gaussian mixture observation models. We derive the update equations in fairly explicit detail but we do not prove any conver-gence properties. We try to emphasize intuition rather than mathematical rigor. ii 1 Maximum-likelihood Recall the definition of the maximum-likelihood estimation problem. We have a density function p(xj) that is governed by the set of parameters (e.g., p might be a set of Gaussians and could be the means and covariances). We also have a data set of size N, supposedly drawn from this distribution, i.e., X = fx 1 : : : : x N g. That is, we assume that these data vectors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with distribution p. Therefore, the resulting density for the samples is p(X j) = N Y i=1 p(x i j) = L((jX): This function L((jX) is called the likelihood of the parameters given the data, or just the likelihood function. The likelihood is thought of as a function of the parameters where the data X is fixed. In the maximum likelihood problem, our goal is to find the that maximizes L. That is, we wish to find where = argmax L((jX): Often we maximize log(L((jX)) instead because it is analytically easier.},

Errors often exist for both measurements. In this work, we examine two regression approaches available to accommodate this situation. They are orthogonal regression and geometric mean regression.

Findings – The paper finds that in the long run, the extent of national SRI-related regulation will probably depend on the extent to which the social, environmental, and other risks targeted by SRI represent social risks (which can be mitigated by regulation as opposed to other policy instruments). Practical implications – While Turkish private pension fund regulators should be mindful of wariness of other OECD member countries to regulate SRI, the particularity of the social risks faced by Turkish financial markets may militate for a unique national approach toward SRI regulation. Originality/value – This study represents one of the first attempts to address the issue of domestic SRI regulation and to present evidence-based conclusions in a policy oriented setting.},

I use daily data to investigate the way in which the Conference and related policies associated to the gold standard affected commodity prices, bond prices, and the stock market. My results show that the Conference itself did not impact commodity prices or the stock market. However, it had a small effect on bond prices. I do find that the events associated with the abandonment of the gold standard impacted prices in a significant way, even before the actual monetary and currency channels were at work. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent (1983).},

	abstract = {Resumen: La cobertura de pensiones contributivas en México es baja, y la alta movilidad entre el mercado laboral formal e informal conduce a bajas densidades de cotización que no garantizan acceder a una pensión mínima. El Estado ha creado programas de transferencias, pero cuyo diseño puede desincentivar la formalidad. Este trabajo propone una pensión proporcional y condicionada a la participación en empleos formales reemplazando las transferencias de monto fijo de estos programas, siguiendo la experiencia reciente en Chile. Utilizamos el diseño propuesto por Valdés-Prieto (2008), el cual minimiza las distorsiones en el mercado laboral. Bajo el supuesto de trayectoria lineal de ingresos, nuestra estimación arroja incrementos promedio en el valor total de las pensiones de 45.6\% y un ahorro fiscal de 14.8\% con respecto a otorgar la transferencia no contributiva como el programa “65 y más”. / Contributory pension system coverage has been historically low. High mobility between formal and informal sector results in low contribution density which does not guarantee a minimum pension. The state has created cash transfer programs, which can disincentive formality. This paper proposes a proportional pension for formal employees, which replaces the fixed cash transfer, following the experience of Chile (2008). We follow the Valdés-Prieto approach (2008), which minimizes la-bor-market distortions. Under the assumption of linear income trajectory, we show that the total value of pensions can increase in 45.6\% on average, and fiscal savings in 14.8\% when compared to a non-contributory pension programas “65 y más”.},

	abstract = {The reform of the pension system of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in 1997, limited the growing fiscal cost of the previous pay-as-you-go scheme. Sixteen years on from its creation, the Retirement Savings System (SAR) has had favourable macroeconomic effects for Mexico, as it has significantly increased financial savings and encouraged the development of local financial markets. However, the employment and pension coverage has not developed as hoped, due to the high rate of informality in the labour market. In addition, the replacement rates (RR) forecast for old-age pensions from the defined-contribution scheme will be low, due to problems exogenous to the pension system, such as low contribution rates and low contribution densities. The main objective of this study is to develop a macroeconomic and actuarial projection model to simulate the expected coverage and RR for the period 2012–2050, within the framework of a demographic and economic forecast that will allow a detailed diagnosis of the current conditions of the pension system. The results reveal the unpromising scenario that the pension system has and will continue to have in the long term, with limited improvements in coverage rates. The possibility of obtaining adequate pensions will be restricted to those who have socioeconomic conditions with a long employment history, who can thus make contributions to their individual accounts. Taking into account this baseline projection scenario, we simulate the expected effects of applying a set of proposals with the aim of tackling the main problems, such as the low coverage, low RR, and low level of participation by young people in the system.},

This especially is the case in Switzerland, one of the world’s largest markets for corporate pension funds. We create a new liability benchmark for referencing the asset performance. Measuring the asset performance with respect to the liability benchmark yields the Asset-Liability-Result. We apply the model to (i) the Swiss pension fund market as a whole and (ii) an individual Swiss pension fund. With our new approach, we are able to show that the pension funds’ recovery from the recent financial crisis took much longer than the value increase of the asset portfolios suggests. We strongly advocate the use of a liability benchmark for analyzing the entire pension fund markets’ performance and specifically as operational tool for individual pension funds.},

Furthermore, the persistence of patterns is examined via the correlation in two-step conditional probabilities by using Blomqvist’s beta test. This method is useful to identify patterns even under market booms and busts, and in high and low volatility environments.},

A natural idea when estimating these models is to impose local stationarity conditions, i.e. stationarity within each regime. In this article we show that the local stationarity of the observed process is neither sufficient nor necessary to obtain the global stationarity. We derive stationarity conditions and we compute the autocovariance function of this nonlinear process. Interestingly, it turns out that the autocovariance structure coincides with that of a standard ARMA. Some examples are proposed to illustrate the stationarity conditions. Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the consequences of accounting for the stationarity conditions in statistical inference. © 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, some observers have noted an unusual aspect of the Mexican peso's behavior: During periods when the U.S. dollar has risen (fallen) against other major currencies such as the euro, the peso has risen (fallen) against the dollar. Very few other currencies display this behavior. In this paper, we attempt to explain the unusual pattern of the peso's correlation with the dollar by developing some general empirical models of exchange rate correlations. Based on a study of 29 currencies, we find that most of the cross-country variation in exchange rate correlations with the dollar and the euro can be explained by just a few variables. First, a country's currency is more likely to rise against the dollar as the dollar rises against the euro, the closer it is to the United States and the farther it is from the euro area. In this result, distance likely proxies for the role of economic integration in affecting exchange rate correlations. Second, a country's currency is more likely to exhibit this unusual pattern when its sovereign credit rating is more risky. This may reflect that currencies of riskier countries are less substitutable in investor portfolios than those of better-rated countries. All told, these factors well explain the peso's unusual behavior, as Mexico both is very close to the United States and has a lower credit rating than most industrial economies. ?? 2011.},

Most analyses of portfolio selection, whether they are of the Markowitz-Tobin mean-variance or of more general type, maximize over one period. The present lifetime model reveals that investing for many periods does not itself introduce extra tolerance for riskiness at early, or any, stages of life. The model denies the validity of the concept of businessman's risk, for isoelastic marginal utilities, in your prime of life you have the same relative risk-tolerance as toward the end of life. The "chance to recoup" and tendency for the law of large numbers to operate in the case of repeated investments is not relevant. The analysis for marginal utility with elasticity differing from that of Bernoulli provides an effective counter example, if indeed a counter example is needed to refute a gratuitous assertion.},

The insurer who faces the risk of paying stochastic insurance claims needs to manage her asset and liability by taking into account of the correlation risk. This paper investigates the impact of correlation risk to the optimal asset-liability management (ALM) of an insurer. We employ the Wishart process to model the stochastic covariance matrix of risky asset returns. The insurer aims to minimize the variance of the terminal wealth given an expected terminal wealth subject to the risk of paying out random liabilities of compound Poisson process. This ALM problem then becomes a linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problem with stochastic volatilities, stochastic correlations and jumps.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new view on the gold price of greenbacks during and after the American Civil War by analyzing exchange-rate volatility rather than exchange-rate levels. Our empirical investigation detects regimes of high and low volatility alternating in a way that is consistent with a theoretical exchange-rate model in which the rate is primarily driven by investors’ expectations and not by fundamentals. We interpret these findings as evidence that monetary policy makers were surprisingly able to credibly announce the resumption to gold half a year before it actually took place on January 1, 1879. Given the intense political debate about the appropriate design of the United States’ financial system, this is a remarkable result. It indicates that the policy makers’ ability to anchor investors’ expectations is relevant to achieving asset-price stability as well as effectiveness of financial market regulation. The insights from this historical episode should therefore be of interest to policy makers and regulators combating financial crises like the ongoing current debt crises worldwide.},

Equity returns exhibit higher volatilities and correlations, and lower expected returns, in bear markets compared to bull markets. However, static mean-variance analysis fails to capture this salient feature of equity returns. Using a regime switching model across both regions and sectors, the regime-dependent asset allocation substantially outperforms the static mean-variance allocation. This outperformance is robust to various asset allocation constraints. In addition, optimal allocation across sectors provide greater benefits compared to international diversification, which is characterized by higher returns, lower risks, lower correlations with the world market and a higher Sharpe ratio.},

After using parametric and nonparametric approaches to identify recession periods in the stock market, we consider both in-sample and out-of-sample tests of the variables' predictive ability. Empirical evidence from monthly data on the Standard \& Poor's S\&P 500 price index suggests that among the macroeconomic variables we have evaluated, yield curve spreads and inflation rates are the most useful predictors of recessions in the US stock market, according to both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, comparing the bear market prediction to the stock return predictability has shown that it is easier to predict bear markets using macroeconomic variables. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The extracted Markov switching factor may be interpreted as the coincident index and is comparable to the Stock-Watson index which differs only by the Markov switching component. Using four constituent series of the DOC coincident index for the period January 1960 to June 1992, the proposed model generates recessionary and expansionary periods which are remark- ably consistent with the NBER chronology of the business cycles from the noisy monthly data.

	title = {Competition and {Consumer} {Confusion}},
	abstract = {In many markets consumer biases do not affect prices, since competition forcesfirms to price their products close to marginal cost; competition protects the consumer. We show that noisy consumer product evaluations undermine the force of competition, enabling firms to charge high mark-ups in equilibrium, even in highly competitive environments. We analyze markets in which rationalfirms sell goods to consumers who evaluate products with noise. Using results from extreme value theory, we show that competition generally has a remarkably weak impact on markups. For normally distributed evaluation noise, we show that markups are proportional to the inverse of (ln n){\textasciicircum}(1/2),where n is the number of competitors. In this setting, a highly compet-itive industry with n=1,000,000 firms will retain 1/3 of the markup of a highly concentrated industry with only n=10 competitors. When we make noise an endogenous variable, we find thatfirms choose excess noise by making their products inefficiently confusing. Moreover, com-petition exacerbates this effect: a higher degree of competition causesfirms to choose even more excess complexity. Firms with lower intrinsic quality and higher production costs choose the most excess complexity. Educating consumers to reduce their evaluation noise would generate large welfare gains. But the gains accrue mostly to the consumer, so firms can’t profitably ed-ucate consumers and steal them away from competitors. Finally, we introduce an econometric framework that measures bounded rationality and confusion in the marketplace.},

Our goal is to show that CDS indexes may provide investors and institutions with early warning signals of financial distresses in the stock market.

We observe beta convergence but not sigma convergence; though the sigma values are falling for most of the SADC countries. Under normal conditions, no cointegrating vector was identified when using the US market as benchmark. When using the SSA index as benchmark one cointegrating vector was identified. The paper also takes stock of the extent of software and hardware stock market integration in SADC. The SADC stock exchanges must work towards greater integration so that they can attract more sustained portfolio flows rather than volatile portfolio flows and also greater FDI flows which are much needed for the financial and economic development of the SADC countries. We also need to consolidate and reduce the number of exchanges with the view to improve market capitalization, liquidity, market infrastructure, governance amongst others but most importantly to increase the visibility, robustness and reputation of SADC stock markets at the international level.},

Our results support the presence of three market regimes (low, high and extreme or crash volatility) in those markets with the transition order 'low, crash and high volatility', suggesting that these frontier markets have a different structure than developed markets. The results also yield evidence of herding behavior under the crash regime for all of the markets except Qatar which herds under the high volatility regime. The findings of the cross-GCC herding model also demonstrate herding comovements and not spillovers and are also robust to the cross-GCC volatility shocks. The tests that underline the cross-volatility shocks suggest that the crash regime is a true regime and not a statistical artifact. Policy and portfolio diversification implications are discussed.},

We assess the implication for one-day ahead 95\% and 99\% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts with the test for correct conditional coverage of Christoffersen (1998) and for Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasts with the block-bootstrap test of ES violations of Jalal and Rockinger (2008).

This article provides models of asset returns that match these patterns and illustrates their use in asset allocation. The presence of regimes with different correlations and expected returns is difficult to exploit within a framework focused on global equities. Nevertheless, for global all-equity portfolios, the regime-switching strategy dominated static strategies in an out-of-sample test. In addition, substantial value was added when an investor switched between domestic cash, bonds, and equity investments. In a persistent high-volatility market, the model told the investor to switch primarily to cash. Large market-timing benefits are possible because high-volatility regimes tend to coincide with periods of relatively high interest rates.},

A consistent ‘abnormal’ return in excess of the benchmark is demonstrated over different time horizons and in different real world and simulated stock markets. A measure of stock price dispersion is shown to be a leading indicator for the abnormal return and their relationship is modelled as a Markov switching process of two market regimes. We find that the entire abnormal return is associated with the high volatility regime as the indexing model implicitly adopts a strategic position that pays off during market crashes, whilst effectively tracking the benchmark in normal market circumstances. Therefore we find no evidence of market inefficiency. Nevertheless our results have implications for equity fund managers: we show how, without any stock selection, solely through a smart optimization that has an implicit element of market timing, the benchmark performance can be significantly enhanced},

A Markov switching model of the determinants of changes in the iTraxx Europe indices demonstrates that they are extremely sensitive to stock volatility during periods of CDS market turbulence. But in ordinary market circumstances CDS spreads are more sensitive to stock returns than they are to stock volatility. Equity hedge ratios are three or four times larger during the turbulent period, which explains why previous research on single-regime models finds stock positions to be ineffective hedges for default swaps. Interest rate movements do not affect the financial sector iTraxx indices and they only have a significant effect on the other indices when the spreads are not excessively volatile. Raising interest rates may decrease the probability of credit spreads entering a volatile period.},

GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

This test exploits mixture properties implied by the regime-switching process, but ignores certain implied serial correlation properties. When formulated in the natural way, the setting is nonstandard, involving nuisance parameters on the boundary of the parameter space, nuisance parameters identified only under the al- ternative, or approximations using derivatives higher than second order. We exploit recent advances by Andrews (2001) and contribute to the literature by extending the scope of mixture models, obtaining asymptotic null distributions different from those in the literature. We further provide critical values for popular models or bounds for tail probabilities that are useful in constructing conservative critical values for regime- switching tests.We compare the size and power of our statistics to other useful tests for regime switching via Monte Carlo methods and find relatively good performance. We apply our methods to reexamine the classic cartel study of Porter (1983) and reaffirm Porter’s findings},

As this is essentially a problem of identifying the collapsing periods from the expanding ones, we propose using a generalization of the Dickey±Fuller test procedure which makes use of the class of Markov regime-switching models. The potential of the new methodology is illustrated via simulation, and an empirical example is given. Copyright \#1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

I develop an open-economy model to mimic the economic conditions in Imperial Spain. I then present new consumption weights built from primary sources, which I combine with existing price data to produce price indexes for traded and non-traded goods; these are then used to test the implications of the model in a Markov-switching regression framework. I identify a strong and persistent increase in the relative price of non-traded goods coinciding with the silver discoveries, lasting for almost three decades and reversing itself only after the 1575 and 1579 crown bankruptcies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Our sample period begins in 2004, after a period of calm and tranquillity, and ends in 2009, with a significant widening of sovereign bond spreads. Our results show evidence of time-varying level of integration for all European countries and suggest that, from the beginning of the financial market tensions in August 2007, markets moved towards higher segmentation, and the differentiation of country risk factors increased substantially across countries. However, the impact of the financial and economic crisis has been much more harmful for EMU members’ sovereign bond markets, since it has prompted an important},

However, Jeanne and Masson (2000) assume that the transition probabilitiesacross equilibria are constant and independent of fundamentals. Thus, currency crisis isdriven by a sunspot unrelated to fundamentals. This paper further contributes to theliterature by suggesting a multivariate MRS model to analyse the nature of currencycrises. In the new set up, one can test for the impact of the unobserved dynamics offundamentals on the probability of devaluation. Empirical evidence shows thatexpectations about fundamentals, which are reflected by their unobserved state variables,not only affect the probability of devaluation but also can be used to forecast a currencycrisis one period ahead.},

In their investment deci- sions, investors in SRI funds may be more concerned with ethical or social issues than with fund performance. Therefore, SRI money flows are less related to past fund returns. Ethical money is less sensitive to past negative returns than are conventional fund flows, especially when SRI funds primarily use negative or Sin/Ethical screens. Social attributes of SRI funds weaken the relation between money inflows and past positive returns. However, money flows into funds with environmental screens are more sensitive to past positive returns than are conventional fund flows. Stock picking based on in-house SRI research increases the money flows. These results give evidence on the role of nonfinancial attributes, which induce heterogeneity of investor clienteles within SRI funds. We find no evidence of a smart money effect, as the funds that receive more inflows neither outperform nor underperform their bench- marks or conventional funds.},

We use country specific, euro area, and US macro-finance factors to determine the conditional volatility and conditional return. We find that the risk-return trade-off is generally negative. The Markov switching model documents that there is time-variation in this trade-off that is linked to the state of the economy, but not the business cycles. Quantile regressions show that the risk-return trade-off is stronger at the lowest quantile of the conditional return.},

Unlike previous models, our factor model allows asset exposures and volatilities to vary with both structural changes and temporary fluctuations in the economic and financial environment. First, we find that globalization and integration have lead to a gradual convergence of country to industry betas, especially in Europe. Second, the structurally-driven increase in market betas is accompanied by a gradual decrease in country-specific risk. Third, even though the edge has structurally decreased, geographical diversification continues being superior to industry diversification.},

Although the global financial market is becoming more integrated, the findings sug-gest that adding lower and upper weighting bounds reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the potential economic value of international investment. The addition of investment constraints makes asset allocation more feasible and decreases the volatility in portfolio return. The time-variation in the optimal asset allo-cation implies that fund managers should rebalance international portfolios dynamically. The out-of-sample test suggests that the Markowitz model with constraints realizes trivial improvement in mean-variance efficiency but still demonstrates significant reduc-tion in risk.},

	abstract = {The Markowitz critical line method for mean–variance portfolio construc- tion has remained highly influential today, since its introduction to the finance world six decades ago. The Markowitz algorithm is so versatile and computationally effi- cient that it can accommodate any number of linear constraints in addition to full allocations of investment funds and disallowance of short sales. For the Markowitz algorithm to work, the covariance matrix of returns, which is positive semi-definite, need not be positive definite. As a positive semi-definite matrix may not be invertible, it is intriguing that the Markowitz algorithm always works, although matrix inversion is required in each step of the iterative procedure involved. By examining some rele- vant algebraic features in the Markowitz algorithm, this paper is able to identify and explain intuitively the consequences of relaxing the positive definiteness requirement, as well as drawing some implications from the perspective of portfolio diversifica- tion. For the examination, the sample covariance matrix is based on insufficient return observations and is thus positive semi-definite but not positive definite. The results of the examination can facilitate a better understanding of the inner workings of the highly sophisticated Markowitz approach by themany investors who use it as a tool to assist portfolio decisions and by the many students who are introduced pedagogically to its special cases.},

	abstract = {mlogit is a package for R which enables the estimation of the multinomial logit models with individual and/or alternative specific variables. The main extensions of the basic multinomial model (heteroscedastic, nested and random parameter models) are implemented. An introductory example The logit model is useful when one tries to explain discrete choices, i.e. choices of one among several mutually exclusive alternatives 1. There are many useful applications of discrete choice modelling in different fields of applied econometrics, using individual data, which may be : • revealed preferences data which means that the data are observed choices of individuals for, say, a transport mode (car, plane and train for example), • stated preferences data ; in this case, individuals face a virtual situation of choice, for example the choice between three train tickets with different characteristics :-A : a train ticket which costs 10 euros, for a trip of 30 minutes and one change,-B : a train ticket which costs 20 euros, for a trip of 20 minutes and no change,-C : a train ticket which costs 22 euros, for a trip of 22 minutes and one change. Suppose that, in a transport mode situation, we can define an index of satisfaction V j for each alternative which depends linearly on cost (x) and time (z) :      V 1 = α 1 + βx 1 + γz 1 V 2 = α 2 + βx 2 + γz 2 V 3 = α 3 + βx 3 + γz 3 1 For an extensive presentation of the logit model, see Train (},

	abstract = {Written by leading market risk academic, Professor Carol Alexander, Practical Financial Econometrics forms part two of the Market Risk Analysis four volume set. It introduces the econometric techniques that are commonly applied to finance with a critical and selective exposition, emphasising the areas of econometrics, such as GARCH, cointegration and copulas that are required for resolving problems in market risk analysis. The book covers material for a one-semester graduate course in applied financial econometrics in a very pedagogical fashion as each time a concept is introduced an empirical example is given, and whenever possible this is illustrated with an Excel spreadsheet. All together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study. Across all four volumes there are approximately 300 numerical and empirical examples, 400 graphs and figures and 30 case studies many of which are contained in interactive Excel spreadsheets available from the the accompanying CD-ROM . Empirical examples and case studies specific to this volume include:* Factor analysis with orthogonal regressions and using principal component factors;* Estimation of symmetric and asymmetric, normal and Student t GARCH and E-GARCH parameters;* Normal, Student t, Gumbel, Clayton, normal mixture copula densities, and simulations from these copulas with application to VaR and portfolio optimization;* Principal component analysis of yield curves with applications to portfolio immunization and asset/liability management;* Simulation of normal mixture and Markov switching GARCH returns;* Cointegration based index tracking and pairs trading, with error correction and impulse response modelling;* Markov switching regression models (Eviews code);* GARCH term structure forecasting with volatility targeting;* Non-linear quantile regressions with applications to hedging.},

	abstract = {Summary Episodic memories are information-rich, often multisensory events that rely on binding different elements [1]. The elements that will constitute a memory episode are processed in specialized but distinct brain modules. The binding of these elements is most likely mediated by fast-acting long-term potentiation (LTP), which relies on the precise timing of neural activity [2]. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus orchestrate such timing as demonstrated by animal studies in vitro [3, 4] and in vivo [5, 6], suggesting a causal role of theta activity for the formation of complex memory episodes, but direct evidence from humans is missing. Here, we show that human episodic memory formation depends on phase synchrony between different sensory cortices at the theta frequency. By modulating the luminance of visual stimuli and the amplitude of auditory stimuli, we directly manipulated the degree of phase synchrony between visual and auditory cortices. Memory for sound-movie associations was significantly better when the stimuli were presented in phase compared to out of phase. This effect was specific to theta (4 Hz) and did not occur in slower (1.7 Hz) or faster (10.5 Hz) frequencies. These findings provide the first direct evidence that episodic memory formation in humans relies on a theta-specific synchronization mechanism.},

	abstract = {Multivariate GARCH specifications are typically determined by means of practical considerations such as the ease of estimation, which often results in a serious loss of generality. A new type of multivariate GARCH model is proposed, in which potentially large covariance matrices can be parameterized with a fairly large degree of freedom while estimation of the parameters remains feasible. The model can be seen as a natural generalization of the O-GARCH model, while it is nested in the more general BEKK model. In order to avoid convergence difficulties of estimation algorithms, we propose to exploit unconditional information first, so that the number of parameters that need to be estimated by means of conditional information is more than halved. Both artificial and empirical examples are included to illustrate the model. Copyright},

The index is based on publicly available data describing a six-market partition of the financial system comprising credit, funding, real estate, securitization, foreign exchange, and equity markets. This paper improves upon existing stress measures by objectively selecting between several index weighting methodologies across a variety of monitoring frequencies through comparison against a volatility-based benchmark series. The resulting measure facilitates the decomposition of stress to identify disruptions in specific markets and provides insight into historical stress regimes.},

We use a variety of static and dynamic covariance/correlation prediction models and compare the optimized portfolios' out-of-sample performance. We find that dynamic covariance/correlation models construct portfolios with lower risk and higher out-of-sample risk-adjusted realized return. The tail-risk of the constructed portfolios is also lower. Using a mean-conditional-value-at-risk framework we show that dynamic covariance/correlation models are also successful in constructing portfolios with minimum tail-risk. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper three types of absolute deviations estimator have been examined, and the one based on logarithmic transformation turns out to be particularly appealing.We have shown that this estimator is asymptotically normal and unbiased.

Surprisingly, slight variations in parame- ters, well within estimation error bounds, suffice to make the proxy efficient.

So they neither capture state-dependent behaviour of volatility nor explain why the equity index skew persists into long-dated options. Markov switching (MS) GARCH models specify several volatility states with endogenous conditional skewness and kurtosis; of these the simplest to estimate is normal mixture (NM) GARCH, which has constant state probabilities. We introduce a state-dependent leverage effect to NM-GARCH and thereby explain the observed characteristics of equity index returns and implied volatility skews, without resorting to time-varying volatility risk premia. An empirical study on European equity indices identifies two-state asymmetric NM-GARCH as the best fit of the 15 models considered. During stable markets volatility behaviour is broadly similar across all indices, but the crash probability and the behaviour of returns and volatility during a crash depends on the index. The volatility mean-reversion and leverage effects during crash markets are quite different from those in the stable regime.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of selecting securities for managing an investment portfolio. The field of investment has a long history of detailed analysis by economists and investment analysts. This has resulted in theories of economic behavior (in terms of the securities markets as integral components in economy-wide analyses) and the evolution of a variety of rules of thumb (guided by more or less well founded prognostications) which are designed to steer the investor through complex considerations of yield and risk. Relatively little has been done, however, in devising adequate techniques, of a general kind, which can be used to determine optimum selections for a portfolio after the data have been analyzed, and after the predictions as well as the risk and yield criteria of the investor have been specified. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and explain, by reference to empirical data, some of the recent work done in this area by Dr. Harry Markowitz under the sponsorship of the Cowles Commission. 2 This article is divided into four parts. Part I contains a heuristic introduction to the basic problem together with a mathematical statement of Markowitz's theory of portfolio selection and its basic assumptions. Part II contains a discussion of some of the problems involved in formulating probability beliefs for available investment opportunities. En Part III, the selection technique is demonstrated by application to a very simplified case, and many of the problems involved in more complex cases are brought out. The final section contains a summarization and critique of the theory, its limitations, and its possibilities as a guide to practical decision-making. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

To achieve this objective, we collected three different risk measures based upon mean-variance by Markowitz; semi-variance, mean absolute deviation and variance with skewness. We show that these portfolio optimization problems can now be solved by genetic algorithm if mean-variance, semi-variance, mean absolute deviation and variance with skewness are used as the measures of risk. The robustness of our heuristic method is verified by three data sets collected from main financial markets. The empirical results also show that the investors should include only one third of total assets into the portfolio which outperforms than those contained more assets.},

Esto para observar que podrían no considerarse como tales, poniendo en duda su uso como “referencias neutrales”, según lo proponen Black y Litterman (1992), para la gestión de los mismos.Para probar la eficiencia financiera en estos dos índices, se desarrollaron dos simulaciones de eventos discretos empleando el modelo Markowitz-Tobin-Sharpe-Lintner (Markowitz, 1987, p.5) con datos de frecuencia mensual de sus acciones miembro en una ventana temporal de febrero de 2001 a diciembre de 2010. Los resultados fueron comparados a través del ratio de Sharpe (Sharpe, 1966) y demostraron que, en el corto plazo, los supuestos de equilibrio no se mantienen y las aproximaciones del portafolio de mercado estudiadas resultan ineficientes en relación a otros portafolios óptimos derivados de manera simultánea Abstract The present paper questions the financial efficiency of the most used market portfolio proxies in Spain and Mexico (IBEX35 and IPC) in order to determine if these can be considered the market portfolio and to question if they can be used as “neutrals”, according to Black \& Litterman (1992) proposals in portfolio management.Two discrete event simulations that use the Markowtiz-Tobin-Sharpe-Linter model (Markowitz, 1987, p.5) were performed with monthly data of the stock members of such indexes in a February 2001 to December 2010 time window. The results were tested and compared by using the Sharpe ratio (Sharpe, 1966) and show that the equilibrium assumptions in the market do not hold, leading to the conclusion that the market portfolio proxies are inefficient against some other optimally selected portfolios.},

The framework is developed with respect to the UK and US pension funds (as these share certain common legal characteristics) and focuses on the changes that pension funds adopting such a strategy should make to their investment strategies and governance (particularly through the formulation and articulation of clear investment mission and strong investment beliefs). The article proceeds with a review of socially responsible investment (SRI) and more recent responsible investment (RI) literature, in the context of growing public awareness (but not necessarily understanding) of the concept of sustainability ('Literature review of SRI field: SRI, RI and sustainable investing' section). It then examines the literature on pension fund governance, arguing the need for more detailed practical guidance for funds moving towards sustainable investing, especially for those implementing a sustainable investing strategy ('Anglo-American pension fund governance' section). It presents the framework for the practical implementation of sustainable investing in the 'Sustainable investing framework' section. Finally, we review the relevant Anglo-American legal backdrop, outlining how pension funds adopting our framework should approach their fiduciary obligations, and then discussing potential regulatory enablers of sustainable investment ('Legal context: barriers to and enablers of sustainable investing' section).

Within the framework of this model, we discuss the modern theory of contingent claim valuation, including the celebrated option pricing formula of Black and Scholes. It is shown that the security market is complete if and only if its vector price process has a certain martingale representation property. A multidimensional generalization of the Black-Scholes model is examined in some detail, and some other examples are discussed briefly.},

This difficulty led to estimation procedures either based on a simplification of the model or not dependent on the likelihood. There is no method available to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator without resorting to a modification of the model. A novel approach is developed based on both the Monte Carlo expectation–maximization algorithm and importance sampling to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator and asymptotic variance–covariance matrix of the Markov-switching GARCH model.

This research paper also analyses the Mean reversion phenomenon in emerging and developed stock markets. For this purpose, seven emerging markets and five developed markets were considered. Descriptive statistics showed that the emerging markets have higher returns with the higher risk-return trade-off. In contrast, developed markets have low annual returns with a low risk-return trade-off. Correlation analysis indicated the significant positive correlation among the developed markets, but emerging and developed markets have shown relatively insignificant correlation. Results of ARCH and GARCH revealed that the value of likelihood statistics ratio is large, that entails the GARCH (1,1) model is a lucrative depiction of daily return pattern, that effectively and efficiently capturing the orderly reliance of volatility. The findings of the study showed that the estimate ‘β’ coefficients given in conditional variance equation are significantly higher than the ‘α’, this state of affair entails that bigger market surprises tempt comparatively small revision in future volatility. Lastly, the diligence of the conditional variance estimated by α + β is significant and proximate to integrated GARCH (1,1) model, thus, this indicates, the existing evidence is also pertinent in order to forecast the future volatility. The results signified that the sum of GARCH (1,1) coefficients for all the equity returns’ is less than 1 that is an important condition for mean reversion, as the sum gets closer to 1, hence the Mean reversion process gets slower for all the emerging and developed stock markets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In order to implement this analysis, we apply a CAPM-based methodology and find that in the 1987-2009 period, environmental funds had lower performance than conventional funds with similar characteristics. However, if we focus on a more recent period (2001-2009), green funds achieved adjusted returns not significantly different from the rest of SRI and conventional mutual funds.},

Our conceptual analysis of synchronization is based on the technique of concordance indexes and correlation coefficients obtained by the HAC estimators. The main result of the research shows that there is a high degree of probability that dismissal of employees in the Croatian economy will coincide with the contraction phase in industry. The cyclic phase of growth in job creation in great measure coincides with the cyclic phase of growth in exports and the construction sector, as well as with tourist arrivals. There is an almost perfect synchronization between the cyclic phases of the construction sector and imports. The central conclusion of the paper is that this study can establish stylized facts about the dynamics of Croatian business cycles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, from an empirical standpoint, more research is needed to provide new indicators and evidence of testing socially responsible policies on business performance. This paper aims to devise a set of socially responsible human resource policies, demonstrate the validation of their content through several practices, and review the analysis of their relative weights thanks to the contribution of a panel of academic experts and a professional pretest, conducted in large Spanish companies.},

These may follow any of three paths: (a) The excitation energy is lost without dissociation into radicals (by collision, or possibly radiation, as in aromatic hydrocarbons). (b) The molecules dissociate, but the resulting radicals recombine without escaping from the liquid cage. (c) The molecules dissociate and escape from the cage. In this case we would not expect them to move more than a few molecular diameters through the dense medium before being thermalized. In accordance with the notation introduced by Burton, Magee, and Samuel,22 the molecules following 22 Burton, Magee, and Samuel, J. Chern. Phys. 20, 760 (1952). THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS paths (a) and (b) can be designated H 2 0* and those following path (c) can be designated H 2 0t. It seems reasonable to assume for the purpose of these calculations that the ionized H 2 0 molecules will become the H 20 t molecules, but this is not likely to be a complete correspondence. In conclusion we would like to emphasize that the qualitative result of this section is not critically dependent on the exact values of the physical parameters used. However, this treatment is classical, and a correct treatment must be wave mechanical; therefore the result of this section cannot be taken as an a priori theoretical prediction. The success of the radical diffusion model given above lends some plausibility to the occurrence of electron capture as described by this crude calculation. Further work is clearly needed. A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigatiflg such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},

In our model, the spread determinants' magnitude is conditional on an unobservable endogenous sovereign credit cycle as represented by the underlying state of a Markov regime switching process. Our explanatory variables are motivated in the tradition of structural credit risk models and include changes in asset prices, interest rates, implied market volatility, gold price changes and foreign exchange rates. We examine daily frequency variations of U.S. dollar denominated Eurobond credit spreads of four major Latin American sovereign bond issuers (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) with liquid bond markets during March 2000 to June 2011. We find that spread determinants are statistically significant and consistent with theory, while their magnitude remarkably varies with the state of the credit cycle. Crisis states are characterized by high spread change uncertainty and high sensitivities with respect to the spread change determinants. We further document that not only changes of local currencies, but also changes of the Euro with respect to the U.S. dollar are significant spread drivers and argue that this is consistent with the sovereigns' ability to pay.},

Four models are developed. Three of these are two-state Markov regime-switching models and the other is a single-regime model. The regime-switching models are generated from a combination of different underlying processes for the sto-chastic component of temperature. In Model 1, one regime is governed by a mean-reverting process and the other by a Brownian motion. In Model 2, each regime is governed by a Brownian motion. In Model 3, each regime is governed by a mean-reverting process in which the mean and speed of the mean-reversion remain the same, but only the volatility switches between the states. Model 4 is a single-regime model, where the temperature dynamics are governed by a single mean-reverting process. All four models are utilized to determine the expected heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD), which play a crucial role in the valuation of weather options. A four-year temperature dataset from Toronto, Canada, is used for the analysis. Results demonstrate that Model 1 captures the temperature dynamics more accurately than the other three models. Model 1 is then used to price the monthly call options based on a range of strike HDD. Crown},

The dynamical processes occurring in these domains often exhibit a mixture of different dynamics so that it is common to describe them using Markov Switching vector autoregressive processes. However the estimation of such models is difficult even when the dimension is not so high because of the number of parameters involved. A Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation penalization of the likelihood is proposed to shrink the parameters towards zeros and regularize the inference problem which is generally ill-posed. The Expectation Maximization algorithm built for maximizing the penalized likelihood is described in detail and tested on simulated data and real data consisting of daily mean temperature.},

Journal of Banking and Finance 33, 405-414.] to examine the relationship between crude oil shocks and stock markets. An application to stock markets of UK, France and Japan over the sample period January 1989 to December 2007 illustrates plausible results. We detect two episodes of series behaviour one relative to low mean/high variance regime and the other to high mean/low variance regime. Furthermore, there is evidence that common recessions coincide with the low mean/high variance regime. In addition, we allow both real stock returns and probability of transitions from one regime to another to depend on the net oil price increase variable. The findings show that rises in oil price has a significant role in determining both the volatility of stock returns and the probability of transition across regimes.},

We go beyond previous research by (i) considering oil price volatility in the nineteenth century along with recent data, (ii) applying different types of MSM models and (iii) considering value-at-risk predictions besides our forecasting of volatility. Confirming its successful performance in other studies, the new MSM model comes out as the model that most often across forecasting horizons and subsamples cannot be outperformed by other models.

	abstract = {The present article analyses the alternations in the causality in the financial markets during the 2008–2009 financial crisis with a clear focus on the changes and developments in the financial markets of the Baltic States and Russia in the period starting from 2008. The authors have advanced a hypothesis that the research methods of trends of an abrupt plunge and subsequent stabilistation of equity prices that were clearly discernable during the 1987 crisis are also pointfull for the current financial crisis. The present research was conducted on the basis of the following assumptions: both crises affected financial markets of several nations; a characteristic feature for the inception of the crises is an abrupt fall in equity prices; indications of stabilisation in financial markets become observable before financial experts conclude the end of the financial crisis. To confirm the hypothesis on the similarities of the general trends during the two major international financial crisis, the authors employed empiric tests developed on the basis of Granger causality tests. Based on the precedent survey of the financial crisis of 1987 (Malliaris and Urrutia 1992), the authors of the present article chose to use the Granger causality testing methodology. To be able to apply the Granger causality test first it was necessary to verify the degree of cointegration of the indices of the main equity markets in each of the country (OMX Vilnius, OMX Riga, OMX Tallinn, RTS). For that purpose the authors used the Dickey‐Fuller and Johansen testing methodology. Both methodologies demonstrated a strong cointegration between the changes in the indices of all equity markets irrespective of the period analysed (i.e., pre‐crisis, during the crisis, post‐crisis). In all cases the T‐statistics exceeded the critical value. The strongest cointegration was observable in the crisis period, and the weakest – after the crisis. The results showed that in view of the financial crisis the Latvian market showed the greatest degree of slow‐down despite it being most active in the pre‐crisis times, likewise, Estonian market also showed a somewhat higher degree of passiveness. Thus, it was the Latvian and Estonian markets that the financial downturn had the most painful impacts upon. While the Lithuanian and the Russian markets were, on the contrary, much more active and therefore outlived the equity crash period with least painful after‐effects, thus producing confirmation that in the face of a crisis the interests and expectations of most investors are largely related to major markets normally viewed as more reliable and showing a higher degree of resilience. Santrauka Straipsnyje analizuojami finansų rinkų priežastingumo pokyčiai 2008–2009 m. finansinės krizės laikotarpiu. Pagrindinis dėmesys sutelkiamas į Baltijos šalių– Lietuvos, Latvijos ir Estijos – bei Rusijos akcijų rinkų pokyčius nuo 2008 m. Autoriai iškelia hipotezę, kad finansų rinkose staigaus akcijų kainų kritimo ir jų stabilizavimosi tendencijos, kurios išryškejo nuo 1987 m. prasidėjusios krizės, būdingos dabartinei finansinei krizei. Tyrimo metu daromos prielaidos: abi krizės apima daugelio valstybių finansų rinkas; krizių pradžiai būdingas staigus akcijų kainų kritimas; finansų rinkų stabilizavimosi požymiai pastebimi anksčiau, nei ekspertai konstatuoja krizės pabaigą. Dviejų tarptautinių finansų rinkų krizių bendrųjų tendencijų panašumo hipotezei patvirtinti naudoti empiriniai testai, parengti remiantis Granger priežastiniais testais: Granger priežastiniai testai ir kointegracijos testai. Nustatyta, kad finansinės krizės metu Latvijos rinka tapo pasyviausia, nors iki prasidedant krizei buvo pati aktyviausia, pasyvesne tapo ir Estijos rinka. Taigi finansinis nuosmukis skaudžiausiai paveikė Latvijos ir Estijos finansų rinkas. Lietuvos ir Rusijos rinkos krizės metu tapo pačios aktyviausios ir lengviausiai išgyveno akcijų kainų kritimo perioda, tuo patvirtindamos, kad krizės metu daugelio investuotojų interesai ir lūkesčiai paprastai siejami su didesnemis rinkomis, kurios laikomos patikimesnėmis ir turinčiomis galimybę greičiau atsigauti.},

The exact cause of economic bubbles has been analyzed by many economists. The article discusses with different theories explaining the causes of bubbles formation and presents the possibilities to apply Logistic function for prediction of bubbles enabling to take preventive measures against bubbles creation. Some economists think that bubbles are related to inflation and therefore believe that the factors causing inflation could also be the same factors that cause bubbles to occur. Other economists think that there is a basic fundamental value to every asset and the bubbles represent an increase or rise over that fundamental value. There are also chaotic theories regarding the formation of bubbles. These theories argue that bubbles come from certain critical states on the market that originate from the communication of economic players. The aim of the article is to present a new theory explaining formation of economic bubbles based on Logistic growth models encountering the limited (financial, natural, physical, human etc.) capital resources.

This research paper also analyses the Mean reversion phenomenon in emerging and developed stock markets. For this purpose, seven emerging markets and five developed markets were considered. Descriptive statistics showed that the emerging markets have higher returns with the higher risk-return trade-off. In contrast, developed markets have low annual returns with a low risk-return trade-off. Correlation analysis indicated the significant positive correlation among the developed markets, but emerging and developed markets have shown relatively insignificant correlation. Results of ARCH and GARCH revealed that the value of likelihood statistics ratio is large, that entails the GARCH (1,1) model is a lucrative depiction of daily return pattern, that effectively and efficiently capturing the orderly reliance of volatility. The findings of the study showed that the estimate ‘β’ coefficients given in conditional variance equation are significantly higher than the ‘α’, this state of affair entails that bigger market surprises tempt comparatively small revision in future volatility. Lastly, the diligence of the conditional variance estimated by α + β is significant and proximate to integrated GARCH (1,1) model, thus, this indicates, the existing evidence is also pertinent in order to forecast the future volatility. The results signified that the sum of GARCH (1,1) coefficients for all the equity returns’ is less than 1 that is an important condition for mean reversion, as the sum gets closer to 1, hence the Mean reversion process gets slower for all the emerging and developed stock markets.},

In a first step, a Markov-switching model with two regimes (a calm market and a turbulent market) is developed. Based on the time series of the monthly returns of the S\&P 500 price index, the corresponding filtered probabilities are successively estimated. In a second step, the turbulent phase of the model is further specified to distinguish between bullish and bearish trends. For comparison only, a Markov-switching model with three states (a calmmarket, a turbulent bullishmarket, and a turbulent bearishmarket) is examined as well. In a third step, logistic regression models are employed to forecast the filtered probabilities provided by the Markov- switching models. A major advantage of the presented modeling framework is the timely identification of the factors driving the different phases of the capital market. In a fourth step, the early warning system is applied to an asset management case study. The results show that explicit consideration of the models’ signals yields better portfolio performance and lower portfolio risk compared to standard buy-and-hold and constant proportion portfolio insurance strategies.},

	abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x, first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination a'x, is already stationary, the time series x, are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector a. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that a becomes a matrix. Interpreting a'x, = 0 as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these rep- resentations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a veries of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not Ml, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

	abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autore- gressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

We identify that increased volatilities in four euro-based exchange rates are due to underlying structural changes. Also, we find that currencies are closely related to each other, especially in high-volatility periods, where cross-correlations increase significantly. Using Markov switching Monte Carlo approach we provide evidence in favour of Markov switching models, rejecting random walk hypothesis. Testing in-sample and out-of-sample Markov trading rules based on Dueker and Neely (Journal of Banking and Finance, 2007) we find that using econometric methodology is able to forecast accurately exchange rate movements. When applied to the Euro/US dollar and the euro/British pound daily returns data, the model provides exceptional out-of-sample returns. However, when applied to the euro/Brazilian real and the euro/Mexican peso, the model loses power. Higher volatility exercised in the Latin American currencies seems to be a critical factor for this failure. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This behavior is particularly important in emerging economies in Latin America, and moreover, in the larger stock markets of this region (Brazil, Mexico, and Chile). The Latin American region is highly influenced by macroeconomic factors; therefore, it is relevant to discover ways in which the market index forecast accuracy can be improved. Thus, in this study, we present a novel methodology: first, we forecast the volatility of each market using different GARCH models. Then, we use Markov Switching to determine the states of external factors. Subsequently, these states are combined in a ANFIS model to determine individual impact on each index, and finally, we use an ANN algorithm to improve the forecast accuracy of the best GARCH model forecast with the combined effects of all the external factors. The results indicate that this methodology manages to improve prediction in terms of MAPE and RMSE, thus providing a more accurate volatility estimation.},

However, supporting evidence is limited, and results are markedly different across the countries. It is worth noting that the signs on the coefficients for fundamental factors are mostly wrong from the RID model perspective. By using the MSM-RID model, the results identify that two regimes exist and persist, which is consistent with earlier literature indicating that there are complex influences in exchange rate determination. This leads to the conclusion that the results are strongly in favor of a nonlinear relationship between exchange rate volatility and fundamental factors. When the probabilities transition matrixes of MSM are allowed to change [MSM-RID-time varying transition probabilities model (TVTP)], it is found that MSM-RID-TVTP outperforms the MSM-RID model.

For this purpose, we estimate cyclically-adjusted fiscal policy rules for the period 1986–2012 within a Markov-Switching framework. Our results show that the discretionary fiscal behavior of Spanish and euro-area governments has manifested switching properties throughout the last thirty years, uncovering the existence of two fiscal regimes which shift in accordance with the extent of deficit persistence and the intensity of debt-stabilizing and output-countercyclical measures. Irrespective of fiscal regime, the Spanish authorities have committed to meeting the Maastricht criteria and the SGP rules by centering on the public deficit-debt association, whereas the euro-area administrations have engaged in stimulating the economic activity by focusing on the deficit-output gap relation.

Forecast evaluation was based on modern econometric techniques concerning the shape of forecaster's loss function. We also extend the empirical framework suggested by Jeanne and Masson [Jeanne, O., Masson, P., 2000. Currency crises and Markov-switching regimes. Journal of International Economics 50, 327-350] to test for the hypothesis that the currency crisis was driven by sunspots. To this end we contribute to the existing literature by comparing Markov regime switching model with a time-varying transition probabilities with two alternative models. The first is a Markov regime switching model with constant transition probabilities. The second is a linear benchmark model. Empirical results show that the proxy for the probability of devaluation is an important factor explaining the nature of currency crisis. More concretely, when the expectation market pressure was used as a proxy of probability of devaluation, forecast evaluation supports the view that currency crisis was driven by market expectation unrelated to fundamentals. Alternatively, when interest rate differential is used as a proxy for probability of devaluation, currency crisis was due to predictable deterioration of fundamentals. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

As a suggestive exercise, we examine inflation uncertainty in the US, and find that, over 2005–2008, in the absence of an inflation target, uncertainty rose in the US, while uncertainty remained low in the UK over this period of rising com-modity prices and financial turmoil.},

The sample covers major institutional changes, such as market liberalization and financial crises, so as to examine how the short-term and long-term relations change after such events.

(2001) is adopted, which allows us to deal with structural breaks easily, and to handle data that have integrals of different orders. Interest rates and foreign reserves are also included in the analysis to reduce potential omitted variable bias. My empirical results suggest that the comovement between exchange rates and stock prices becomes stronger during crisis periods, consistent with contagion or spillover between asset prices, when compared with tranquil periods. Furthermore, most of the spillovers during crisis periods can be attributed to the channel running from stock price shocks to the exchange rate, suggesting that governments should stimulate economic growth and stock markets to attract capital inflow, thereby preventing a currency crisis. However, the industry causality analysis shows the comovement is not stronger for export-oriented industries for all periods, such as industrials and technology industries, thus implying that comovement between exchange rates and stock prices in the Asian emerging markets is generally driven by capital account balance rather than that of trade.},

	title = {Regime {Shifts}: {Implications} for {Dynamic} {Strategies}},
	volume = {68},
	abstract = {Regime shifts present significant challenges for investors because they cause performance to depart significantly from the ranges implied by long-term averages of means and covariances. But regime shifts also present opportunities for gain. The authors show how to apply Markov-switching models to forecast regimes in market turbulence, inflation, and economic growth. They found that a dynamic process outperformed static asset allocation in backtests, especially for investors who seek to avoid large losses. nvestors have long recognized that economic conditions frequently undergo regime shifts. The economy often oscillates between a steady, low-volatility state characterized by economic growth and a panic-driven, high-volatility state characterized by economic contraction. Evidence of such regimes has been documented in market tur-bulence, 1 inflation, 2 and GDP or GNP. 3 Regime shifts present significant challenges for risk management and portfolio construction. For example, Ang and Bekaert (2002) demonstrated that regimes in financial assets lead to high down-side correlations. Indeed, prior studies have shown that exposure to different countries' equity markets offers less diversification in down markets than in up markets. 4 The same is true for global industry returns (Ferreira and Gama 2004), individual stock returns (Ang and Chen 2002), hedge fund returns (Van Royen 2002), and international bond market returns (Cappiello, Engle, and Sheppard 2003). Recently, Chua, Kritzman, and Page (2009) con-ducted an extensive empirical study of conditional correlations and concluded diversification based on unconditional covariances is largely a myth. Given this widespread evidence of nonsta-tionarity, it may be preferable to manage risk and construct portfolios on the basis of regime-specific estimates of the relevant inputs. The goal of our research was to build regime-dependent invest-ment strategies and backtest their performance out of sample. Many researchers have used Markov-switching models to " fit " a dataset and uncover evidence of regimes in sample, but far fewer have attempted out-of-sample forecasting. Nevertheless, as suggested by Harvey and Dahlquist (2001), if economic conditions are per-sistent and strongly linked to asset performance, then a dynamic asset allocation process should add value over static weights. We built a simple regime-switching model for the following variables (described in detail in the " Defining Economic Regime Variables " section): • Market turbulence • Inflation • Economic growth For each of these variables, we measured the per-formance of a variety of assets and risk premiums under each regime. Next, we turned to out-of-sample forecasting and backtesting. First, we tested the performance of the regime-switching approach for tactical asset allocation. We used regime forecasts to scale expo-sure to specific risk premiums over time and found that a dynamic process outperformed constant exposures. We then applied the same methodology to dynamic asset allocation across stocks, bonds, and cash. Again, we found that a dynamic process outperformed static asset allocation, especially for investors who seek to avoid large losses.},

Neither linear single-equation modelling nor linear multi-equation systems capture efficiently this relationship. The presence of several episodes of financial crises alters the speed and degree of response to shocks in the interbank rate. Thus, a Markov switching VAR model shows that under normal financial conditions short-run stickiness is higher for those rates on loans with higher credit risk. But it also shows that when there is a high-volatility scenario, the pass-through increases considerably for all interest rates.

Special cases and relationships with previously proposed specifications are discussed and stationarity conditions are derived. For the empirically most relevant GARCH(1,1) case, the conditions for existence of arbitrary integer moments are given and analytic expressions of the unconditional skewness, kurtosis, and autocorrelations of the squared process are derived. Finally, employing daily return data on the NASDAQ index, we provide a detailed empirical analysis and compare both the in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance of the MN-GARCH as well as recently proposed Markov-switching models.

An application to returns of international stock and real estate markets shows that correlations between these asset classes increased substantially during the recent financial turmoil; moreover, in the regime–switching framework, employing a Student’s t distribution improves the forecasting performance vis-a`-vis the Gaussian.},

	abstract = {The integration of financial markets across countries has modified the way prices react to news. Innovations originating in one market diffuse to other markets following patterns which usually stress the presence of interdependence. In some cases, though, covariances across markets have an asymmetric component which reflects the dominance of one over the others. The volatility transmission mechanisms in such events may be more complex than what can be modelled as a multivariate GARCH model. In this article, we adopt a new Markov Switching approach and we suppose that periods of high volatility and periods of low volatility represent the states of an ergodic Markov Chain where the transition probability is made dependent on the state of the 'dominant' series. We provide some theoretical background, and illustrate the model on Asian markets data showing support for the idea of dominant market and the good prediction performance of the model on a multi-period horizon.

	abstract = {Exchange rate policy in many emerging markets shifts between a stronger and weaker commitment to peg. This observation raises the following questions, which we address in our paper: Does intervention policy exhibit switching? And if so, what causes policy to shift? The theoretical literature increasingly points to the critical importance of financial fundamentals (Chinn, M.D., Kletzer, K.M., 2001. Imperfect information, domestic regulation and financial crises. In: Glick, R., Moreno, R., Spiegel, M. (Eds.), Financial Crises in Emerging Markets. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 196-237; Dooley, 2000; Chang, R., Velasco, A., 2005. Monetary policy and the currency denomination of debt: a tale of two equilibria. Kennedy School of Government Working Paper Series, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; among others). Direct empirical validation to date is limited, however, although relevant intuitions come from duration and indicators literature (Kaminsky, G.L., Reinhart, C.M., Vegh, C.A., 2004. When it rains, it pours: procyclical capital flows and macroeconomic policies. NBER Macroeconomics Annual, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.; Domac, I., Peria, M.S., 2003. Banking crises and exchange rate regimes: is there a link? Journal of International Economics 61, 41-72; Tudela, M., 2004. Explaining currency crises: a duration model approach. Journal of International Money and Finance 23, 799-816). We use a panel of quarterly data starting 1985 through 2004 for 14 countries, mainly from Latin America and East Asia, and adopt a novel two-step empirical strategy. First, we apply regime switching methods to two simple indices of central bank exchange rate policy. This generates likelihoods of high and low intervention. In the second step, we establish the variables that determine these probabilities. We find strong evidence that the economy's balance sheet and economic performance determine the likelihood of switching in the exchange rate regime. Specifically, an increase in reserve currency debt relative to assets raises potential capital losses from devaluation and reduces the probability of switching to a low intervention regime, as does a decline in growth. The purpose here is not to present an alternative regime classification (Levy-Yeyati, E., Sturzenegger, S., 2005. Classifying exchange rate regimes: deeds vs. words. European Economic Review 49, 1603-1635; Reinhart, C.M., Rogoff, K., 2004. The modern history of exchange rate arrangements: a reinterpretation. Quarterly Journal of Economics, Available at: http://www.puaf.umd.edu/faculty/papers/reinhart/papers.htm), but to establish the relative importance of different constraints on the central bank, which has policy implications. The empirical approach and specification is flexible to whether intervention is discrete or gradual and to whether or not the central bank sterilizes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use weekly data for the period January 1988 to July 2006 and we conduct our analysis in two parts. First, using the estimation of a Dynamic Conditional Correlation model we find that the short-term interdependencies between the Latin America stock markets and the developed stock market strengthened during the Asian, Latin American and Russian financial crises of 1997-1998. However, after the initial period of disturbance they eventually returned to almost their initial (relatively low) levels. Second, the estimation of a SWARCH-L model reveals the existence of more than one volatility regime and we detect a significant increased volatility during the period of crisis for all the markets under examination, although the capital flows liberalization process has only caused moderate shifts in volatility.},

This study aims to examine the rela-tionship between external indebtedness and growth variables. In this context, Markov-switching model is used because it allows the examination of unobservable variables in an observable model and provides steady algo-rithm to achieve robust optimization by iterations in a dynamic system, and is more flexible than prior models. This paper concentrates on the analysis of Turkey and utilizes the data set for the period of 1974 to 2009. Throughout the analyses, the relationship between growth and external borrowing is examined in terms of pub-lic and private external borrowing. Paper yields that, according to results of multivariate dynamic Markov-switching model, the main growth variables such as investment and human capital have positive impact on growth as expected. Findings can be summarized as follows; firstly, public and/or private external borrowing has negative impact on growth both in regime at zero and regime at one. Secondly, the negative impact of public borrowing on economic growth and development is higher than that of private borrowing on economic growth and development. Eventually, the conclusion reveals that the economic development and borrowing variables do not follow a linear path.},

	abstract = {In this paper the interest rate-exchange rate nexus and the effectiveness of an interest rate defense are investigated empirically. I present a reduced form evidence which characterizes the empirical relationship between interest rates and exchange rates. I use a Markov-switching specification of the nominal exchange rate with time-varying transition probabilities. Empirical evidence from six developing countries: Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey indicates that raising nominal interest rates leads to a higher probability of switching to a crisis regime. Thus, the empirical results presented here may support the view that a high interest rate policy is unable to defend the exchange rate. Unlike other studies which consider linear models only, my findings are robust and consistent over different countries and crisis episodes (Asian 1997 crises, Mexico 1994 crisis, and Turkey 1994, 2001 crises). In order to explain the empirical findings, I construct a simple theoretical model by incorporating an interest rate rule in the model proposed by Jeanne and Rose (2002) [Jeanne, O., Rose, A.K., 2002. Noise trading and exchange rate regimes, Quarterly Journal of Economics. 117 (2) 537-569]. The model has multiple equilibria, and under plausible conditions, higher exchange rate volatility is associated with higher interest rates.},

On the whole we find that: (1) Israel and Turkey are most strongly integrated with world financial markets; (2) in most other MENA markets examined there is primarily local pricing of risk and evidence of a positive risk-return trade-off; and (3) there is substantial time variation in the weights on local and global pricing of risk for all of these markets.

The results also suggest that emerging BRIC markets are more prone to financial contagion, while the industry-specific turmoil has a larger impact than country-specific crises.

Using a mixture version of the standard regime-switching model, we find that the 18 analysed emerging markets can be clustered into three groups. Whereas each of these three groups is characterized by the same two regimes—a bull state with positive returns and low volatility and a bear state with negative returns and high volatility—they clearly differ with respect to their regime-switching dynamics. The first group contains stock markets which swing frequently between the two regimes, the second group shows more regime persistence, and the third group consists of stock markets that are less likely than the others to move to a bear regime period. Standard practice among stock market analysts is to group emerging markets by geographical region. The fact that our model-based clustering is only weakly related to such a regional classification demonstrates the limited validity of the latter. Moreover, a detailed analysis of regime synchronicities across the 18 studied emerging markets shows that there is evidence of regime synchronicity for certain pairs of markets, but this does not rule out that two synchronized markets have different regime dynamics and thus belong to different regime-switching clusters. Hence, our results show that it is incorrect to treat the studied emerging markets as a single homogeneous group because there is strong evidence for substantial differences in their regime-switching dynamics},

To reflect the time-varying component of cross-market dependence, we propose a time-varying correlation test for contagion. Our results show that out of the countries reporting contagion evidence under the constant correlation test, none of the countries exhibits contagion evidence from the 1997 Asian crisis. We conclude that a high level of cross-market correlation during a crisis reported as contagion evidence under the standard constant correlation test is mostly due to the high level of cross-market co-movement resulting from the intertemporal risk-return adjustment.},

Further, we apply this generalized DCC model to the domestic-global portfolio establishment and a comparative analysis with the conventional CCC (constant conditional correlation) is conducted. Our empirical results are consistent with the following notions. First, the domestic and global markets are strongly correlated when both simultaneously find themselves in the same state of volatility. Conversely, this correlation is weaker when a different volatility state characterizes each market. Second, persistence and correlation clustering are presented in domestic-global markets, whereas this self-dependent process involved in cross-market correlations is insignificant in certain markets. Third, market inte-gration leads to an increase in co-movement between domestic and global markets. Finally, although the domestic-global portfolio effectiveness tests demonstrated the superior per-formance of our generalized DCC model in comparison with the conventional CCC and DCC models, we further indicate that the benefits mainly rely on reductions in risk, rather than increases in mean returns.},

This approach, which combines PCA with GARCH volatility modelling, filters away idiosyncratic news and focuses on spreads dynamics driven by common factors. We find convincing evidence of co-movements between spread changes; more within than across geographical areas. Conditional covariations increase in periods of turbulence and subsequently subside. The time-varying minimum variance artificial portfolios, which are used here for model validation, show that, in spite of systemic risk, international portfolio diversification is still a powerful strategy for risk reduction.},

Since the introduction of the mean-variance model, variance has become the most common risk measure used by practitioners and researchers in portfolio optimization. However, the mean-variance model relies strictly on the assumptions that assets returns are multivariate normally distributed or investors have a quadratic utility function. Many studies have proposed different risk measures to overcome the drawbacks of variance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and compare the portfolio compositions and performances of four different portfolio optimization models employing different risk measures, specifically the variance, absolute deviation, minimax and semi-variance. Results of this study show that the minimax model outperforms the other models. The minimax model is appropriate for investors who have a strong downside risk aversion.},

We use monthly CPI inflation rates for the period 1970-2006. Given the long observation period and the continuing economic integration of Europe's economies, we first try to investigate, if there were changes in inflation dynamics in these countries using univariate Markov-switching models. To assess the inflation transmission mechanism, we first establish a long-run relationship between the five countries using cointegration methods. As implied by the results of the univariate models, we allow for changes in the adjustment coefficients of the cointegrating relationships and the short-run dynamics. Using a Markov-switching vector error correction model we find evidence for multiple regime switches during the early 1970s till the mid 1980s. Exactly during this period we find evidence for Germany being weakly exogenous, which highlights the dominance of German monetary policy at this time. Since the mid-1980s we find evidence for a stable transmission mechanism both in the long-and the short-run characterized by a low degree of inflation persistence.},

	abstract = {© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the differences in financial performance portfolios between sustainable and non-sustainable firms through the use of portfolio theory and OptQuest algorithms from 2007 to 2013. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 1,078 firms from 15 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A maximisation weighted ratio is estimated by applying OptQuest algorithms to measure the portfolio performance considering a fuzzy Jensen’s alpha and the percentage of the portfolio’s performance that exceeds the market. Findings: The results show a similar financial performance in sustainable portfolios (SP) and non-SP, but considering the uncertainty, the performance in sustainable firms was better than that of non-sustainable ones. Uncertainty was reduced, as it passed the beginning of the crisis from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is the different assessments of sustainability indexes in each of the countries. Practical implications: The results help investors assess their decisions in an uncertain economic environment and allocate their investment in not only financial terms but also social character. Social implications: Countries with higher financial performances in SP show the efficiency in their legal environmental regulations. On the other hand, the degree of uncertainty is lower in the SP than non-SP, suggesting that sustainable firms in financial crisis could be more responsible in social claims such as good working conditions. Originality/value: This study contributes to existing research in two ways. First, the paper studies corporate social responsibility by different continents and countries in an uncertain economic timespan. For this, the legal, cultural and socioeconomic divergences and convergences were explored. Second, the research presented an analysis of the financial performance differences between sustainable and non-SP by applying a hybrid methodology with fuzzy regression and OptQuest algorithms.},

By using statistical and econometric tools, we first attempt to identify the long term relationship between WTI spot prices and the prices of futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Subsequently we model the short term dynamic between these two prices and this analysis points up several breaks. On this basis, a short term Markov Switching Vectorial Error Correction model (MS-VECM) with two distinct states (standard state and crisis state) has been estimated. Finally we introduce the volumes of transactions observed on the NYMEX for the WTI contracts and we estimate the influence of the non-commercial players. We conclude that the hypothesis of an influence of non-commercial players on the probability for being in the crisis state cannot be rejected. In addition, we show that the rise in liquidity of the first financial contracts, as measured by the volume of open interest, is a key element to understand the dynamics in market prices.},

Novy-Marx (2012) shows that the intermediate return momentum strategy formed using only twelve to seven months of returns prior to portfolio formation significantly outperforms the recent return momentum formed using six to two month returns prior. This paper proposes a more granular strategy termed ‘microscopic momentum’, which further decomposes the intermediate and recent return momentum into single-month momentum components. The novel decomposition reveals that a microscopic momentum strategy generates persistent economic profits even after controlling for sector-specific or month-of-year commodity seasonality effects. Moreover, we show that the intermediate return momentum in the commodity futures must be considered largely illusory, and all 12 months of past returns play important roles in determining the conventional momentum profits.},

We use 19 portfolio models, in conjunction with dummy variable regression, to demonstrate this harm over the 1997–2015 period. This finding is robust to different estimation periods, risk aversion levels, and the use of two regimes. Harmful diversification into alternatives is not primarily due to transactions costs or non-normality, but to estimation risk. This is larger for alternative assets, particularly during the credit crisis which accounts for the harmful diversification of real estate, private equity and emerging markets. Diversification into commodities, and to a lesser extent hedge funds, remains harmful even when the credit crisis is excluded.},

We expand the set of promising optimization models as well as plausible heuristics and implement a new regression framework to measure performance in the asset allocation context. Analyzing more than 5,000 heuristics, our results show that in fact almost any form of well-balanced allocation over asset classes offers similar diversification gains as even recently developed portfolio optimization approaches.

We find horizon effects in time diversification, risk diversification, inflation hedge and real interest rate qualities. The covariance structure gives insights into which asset classes have a term structure of risk that is different from that of stocks and bonds. The alternative assets classes add value for long-term investors. Differences in strategic portfolios for asset-only and asset-liability investors are due to differences in the global minimum variance and liability hedge portfolio. We find that the benefits of long-term investing are larger when there are liabilities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An essential motive for investing in commodities is to enhance the performance of portfolios traditionally including only stocks and bonds. We analyze the in-sample and out-of-sample portfolio effects resulting from adding commodities to a stock-bond portfolio for commonly implemented asset allocation strategies such as equally- and strategically-weighted portfolios, risk-parity, minimum-variance as well as reward-to-risk timing, mean-variance and Black–Litterman. We analyze different commodity groups such as agricultural and livestock commodities that currently are critically discussed. The out-of-sample portfolio analysis indicates that the attainable benefits of commodities are much smaller than suggested by previous in-sample studies. Hence, in-sample analyses, such as spanning tests, might exaggerate the advantages of commodities. Moreover, the portfolio gains greatly vary between different types of commodities and sub-periods. While aggregate commodity indices, industrial and precious metals as well as energy improve the performance of a stock-bond portfolio for most asset allocation strategies, we hardly find positive portfolio effects for agriculture and livestock. Consequently, investments in food commodities are not essential for efficient asset allocation.},

We show that it is possible to model co-movements for many countries simultaneously using BEKK, DCC, and DECO models. Empirically, we find that correlations have trended upward significantly for both DMs and EMs. Based on a time-varying measure of diversification benefits, we find that it is not possible to circumvent the increasing correlations in a long-only portfolio by adjusting the portfolio weights over time. However, we do find some evidence that adding EMs to a DM-only portfolio increases diversification benefits.},

This wrong incentive exists even if the guarantee is not explicitly granted.

Empirical results show strong evidence of significant volatility spillovers between oil and stock markets, as well as time-varying correlations for various market pairs.

From the empirical analysis, we find that the impact of oil price shocks on stock prices in these large NIEs is mixed, partly in contrast to the effects on the U.S. and developed countries' stock markets.

Using a sample of NYMEX and ICE futures contracts, we establish the existence of a regime process and link this process to market fundamentals. This formulation results in two distinct states: a highly persistent conditional volatility process, characterised by long memory and low sensitivity to market shocks, and a relatively short-lived nonstationary process with less memory but higher sensitivity to shocks. Moreover, to investigate the relationship between disequilibrium and volatility of oil futures across high and low volatility regimes we use augmented regime GARCH models to address in a realistic way the potential diverse response of volatility to forward curve shocks. The performance of these models is compared to benchmarks, using both statistical tests and risk management loss functions. To test the robustness of the forecasting strategies, we also perform a reality check employing the stationary bootstrap approach. The findings of this paper have important implications for decision making concerning trading and risk management, as well as energy market operations, such as refining and budget planning, by providing valuable information on the oil price volatility dynamics and the ability to predict risk.},

We compare the performance of the MSM-POT model with competing self-exciting models and a GARCH-EVT approach in an in-and out-of-sample VaR forecasting exercise based on the extreme returns of six daily commodity futures prices (i.e. Brent and WTI crude oil, cocoa, cotton, copper, and gold).

In the aftermath of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that broke out early 2014, the Russian ruble lost 50\% of its value against the US dollar. The impact of the conflict on Russia may have been amplified by sanctions imposed by Western countries. However, as Russia is heavily dependent on natural resource exports, another factor behind the deterioration could be the sharp decline in oil prices starting in summer 2014. Using high-frequency data on nominal exchange and interest rates, oil prices, actual and unanticipated sanctions, we provide evidence on forces underlying the ruble exchange rate. The analysis is based on cointegrated VAR models, where fundamental long-run relationships are implicitly embedded. The results indicate that the bulk of the depreciation can be related to the decline of oil prices. In addition, unantic-ipated sanctions matter for the conditional volatility of the variables involved. Journal of Comparative Economics 44 (2) (2016) 295-308. DIW Berlin,},

The examined period includes monthly data from January 1992 to June 2017. A Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) is implemented that includes oil prices, the nominal exchange rate, the Mexican stock market index, and the consumer price index. Results indicate that the exchange rate has a negative and statistically significant effect on the stock market index; this indicates that an appreciation of the exchange rate is related to an increase in the stock market index. It is also found that the consumer price index has a positive effect on the exchange rate and a negative effect on the stock market index. The results also indicate that oil prices are statistically significant against the exchange rate, concluding that an increase in oil prices creates an appreciation of the exchange rate. In addition, the impulse-response functions show that the effects found tend to disappear over time.},

	abstract = {The study proposes and a family of regime switching GARCH neural network models to model volatility. The proposed MS-ARMA-GARCH-NN models allow MS type regime switching in both the conditional mean and conditional variance for time series and further augmented with artificial neural networks to achieve improvement in forecasting capabilities. Gray (1996) RS-GARCH model allows within regime heteroskedasticity with markov switching of Hamilton (1989). Firstly, models are extended to fractional integration and asymmetric power GARCH and MS-ARMA-FIGARCH, MS-ARMA-APGARCH, MS-ARMA-FIAPGARCH models are evaluated and discussed. Secondly, in addition to regime swiching type nonlinearity, neural networks based augmentated models are evaluated and discussed. In this respect, MS-ARMA-GARCH models are augmented with Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Elman type Recurrent NN (Elman RNN), Time lag (delay) Recurrent NN (RNN) and Hybrid MLP models. Therefore, the second model group includes MS-ARMA-GARCH-MLP, MS-ARMA-GARCH-RBF, MS-ARMA-GARCH-ElmanRNN, MS-ARMA-GARCH-RNN and MS-ARMA-GARCH-HybridMLP. Thirdly, fractional integrated versions are augmented with neural networks and denoted as MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-MLP, MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-RBF, MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-ElmanRNN, MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-RNN and MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-HybridMLP. Fourth, by allowing asymmetric power transformations, models are further extended to GARCH models. These models are MS-ARMA-APGARCH-RBF, MS-ARMA-APGARCH-ElmanRNN, MS-ARMA-APGARCH-RNN and MS-ARMA-FIGARCH-HybridMLP. Therefore, a total of four group of GARCH models are proposed and evaluated in the study. In the empirical application section, daily stock returns in ISE100 Istanbul Stock Index are modeled and forecasted. Forecast success is evaluated with MAE, MSE and RMSE criteria. Equal forecast accuracy is tested with modified Diebold-Mariano tests. Accordingly, fractional integration and asymmetric power transformation perform better in modeling the daily returns in IMKB100 stock index compared to the simple GARCH and RS-GARCH model of Gray. Hybrid MLP and time lag recurrent architectures (MS-ARMA-FIAPGARCH-HybridMLP and MS-ARMA-FIAPGARCH-RNN) provided the best forecast and modeling performance. In conclusion, the newly proposed GARCH models have significant forecasting improvement and therefore are promising in various economic applications.},

Param- eter estimation is performed by Bayesian analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We conduct a simulation study on three different model setups and evaluate the performance of estimation and model selection. We also apply our modeling methods to high-frequency stock data from Hong Kong. Model selection favors a mixture rather than non-mixture model.

Regime switches occur between high and low cost of carry states via changes in the error correction term or basis. Regime identification is therefore dominated by switches in the mean, not volatility. Relative to a number of alternatives, the proposed models provide superior out of sample forecasts of the covariance matrix particularly for horizons greater than 10 days ahead. When hedging, Markov switching with long memory improves the tail risk of hedged returns beyond 10 day horizons, however there is mixed support for models with volatility asymmetries.

In this paper, we generalize the MixN-GARCH model by relaxing the assumption of constant mixing weights. Two different specifications with time-varying mixing weights are considered. In particular, by relating current weights to past returns and realized (component-wise) likelihood values, an empirically reasonable representation of Engle and Ng's (1993) news impact curve with an asymmetric impact of unexpected return shocks on future volatility is obtained. An empirical out-of-sample study confirms the usefulness of the new approach and gives evidence that the leverage effect in financial returns data is closely connected, in a non-linear fashion, to the time-varying interplay of mixture components representing, for example, various groups of market participants. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In such a case, even if the return distributions are normal in both regimes, the overall distribution is not – it is a mixture of normals. Mean-variance analysis is inappropriate in this framework, and one must either assume a specific utility function or, alternatively, employ the more general and distribution-free Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD rule for the case of mixed normals: the SSDMN rule. This rule is a generalization the mean-variance rule. The cost of ignoring regimes and assuming normality when the distributions are actually mixed normal can be quite substantial – it is typically equivalent to an annual rate of return of 2–3 percent.},

	abstract = {The support vector regression (SVR) is a supervised machine learning technique that has been successfully employed to forecast financial volatility. As the SVR is a kernel-based technique, the choice of the kernel has a great impact on its forecasting accuracy. Empirical results show that SVRs with hybrid kernels tend to beat single-kernel models in terms of forecasting accuracy. Nevertheless, no appli- cation of hybrid kernel SVR to financial volatility forecasting has been performed in previous researches. Given that the empirical evidence shows that the stock mar- ket oscillates between several possible regimes, in which the overall distribution of returns it is a mixture of normals, we attempt to find the optimal number of mix- ture of Gaussian kernels that improve the one-period-ahead volatility forecasting of SVR based on GARCH(1,1). The forecast performance of a mixture of one, two, three and four Gaussian kernels are evaluated on the daily returns of Nikkei and Ibovespa indexes and compared withSVR–GARCHwith Morletwavelet kernel, stan- dard GARCH, Glosten–Jagannathan–Runkle (GJR) and nonlinear EGARCH models with normal, student-t, skew-student-t and generalized error distribution (GED) inno- vations by using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and robust Diebold–Mariano test. The results of the out-of-sample forecasts suggest that the SVR–GARCH with amixture of Gaussian kernels can improve the volatility fore- casts and capture the regime-switching behavior.},

	abstract = {Two prominent economists—one the author of and the other a leading scholar in behavioral finance—debate the current validity of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH). For over 30 years, the idea that capital markets are efficient and that stock prices reflect all publicly available information dominated academic thinking. But the bubble of the late 1990s and recent advances in behavioral finance have forced a re‐thinking. Behavioralists argue that markets are at least “weakly” predictable. They also point to evidence that small investors —typically day traders— as a result of “loss aversion,”“overconfidence,” and other behaviors that are not part of the focus of EMH (though, as Malkiel notes, there is room for irrational investors in an EMH world provided there are enough investors to counteract and correct them). Proponents of EMH, of course, argue that neither individual investors nor active fund managers reliably outperform markets, so there is no point paying for active management. Yet these seemingly disparate views lead to important areas of common ground. In particular, both camps agree that individual investors should stick to broad‐based, low‐cost index funds. And retirement accounts—either 401Ks or social security accounts—should have limited investment selections in order to minimize the possibility that behavioral problems lead to investor mismanagement.},

To prove this, four discrete event simulations were performed using, in the first scenario, a passive portfolio management process with a target position rebalancing discipline and, in the other three, an active portfolio management with a range portfolio rebalancing one. In these last three simulations, a constant covariance, a Gaussian distri- bution ogarch and a Student's t-distribution ogarch covariance matrix were used. The attained results suggest that the Student's t-distribution ogarch matrix is the most suita- ble for the investment process.},

The present work determines the association among policy uncertainty and volatility index, expressed in terms of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and period of empirical work spanning from 2000 to 2018. The results suggest that equity markets’ volatility tends to be very high based on a high degree of policy uncertainty. The findings on the commodity market indicate that crude oil and gold prices remain more volatile during the presidential election and financial crisis. One of the essential results shows that the 2000s boom, early credit crunch, Lehman’s collapse and recession, and fiscal policy battles have significantly affected the equity, currency, and commodity markets. The interest rates and currency markets have responded considerably to Feds’ and EPU index. The empirical outcome provides evidence that implied volatility index is a forward looking expectation of future stock market volatility, and it uncovers that policy uncertainty affects investor sentiment. The present work holds some practical implications for the government to formulate policies to regulate the US market.},

Policy reforms in these countries involve a serious dilemma, especially when they include structural and microeconomic features. On the one hand, entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers must respond to the signals generated by the reform for the new policies to be successful. On the other hand, rational behavior by the private sector calls for withholding investment until much of the residual uncertainty regarding the eventual success of the reform is eliminated. This paper shows that even moderate amounts of policy uncertainty can act as a hefty tax on investment, and that otherwise sensible reforms may prove damaging if they induce doubts as to their permanence.

	abstract = {Can increased uncertainty about the future cause a contraction in output and its components? This paper examines the role of uncertainty shocks in a one-sector, representative-agent, dynamic, stochastic general-equilibrium model. When prices are flexible, uncertainty shocks are not capable of producing business-cycle comovements among key macroeconomic variables. With countercyclical markups through sticky prices, however, uncertainty shocks can generate fluctuations that are consistent with business cycles. Monetary policy usually plays a key role in offsetting the negative impact of uncertainty shocks. If the central bank is constrained by the zero lower bound, then monetary policy can no longer perform its usual stabilizing function and higher uncertainty has even more negative effects on the economy. We calibrate the size of uncertainty shocks using fluctuations in the VIX and find that increased uncertainty about the future may indeed have played a significant role in worsening the Great Recession, which is consistent with statements by policymakers, economists, and the financial press.},

	abstract = {Micro-and macro-level evidence indicates that fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty have a large effect on investment; the impact of uncertainty on investment occurs primarily through changes in credit spreads; and innovations in credit spreads have a strong effect on investment, irrespective of the level of uncertainty. These findings raise a question regarding the economic significance of the traditional "wait-and-see" effect of uncertainty shocks and point to financial distortions as the main mechanism through which fluctuations in uncertainty affect macroeconomic outcomes. The relative importance of these two mechanisms is analyzed within a quantitative general equilibrium model, featuring heterogeneous firms that face time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty, irreversibility, nonconvex capital adjustment costs, and financial frictions. The model successfully replicates the stylized facts concerning the macroeconomic implications of uncertainty and financial shocks. By influencing the effective supply of credit, both types of shocks exert a powerful effect on investment and generate countercyclical credit spreads and procyclical leverage, dynamics consistent with the data and counter to those implied by the technology-driven real business cycle models.},

The question whether investor sentiment expressed on the Internet platforms has an impact on asset return has not been fully addressed. To this end, this paper uses the Baidu Searching Index as the agent variable to detect the effect of online investor sentiment on the asset price movement in the Chinese stock market. The empirical study shows that although there is a cointegration relationship between online investor sentiment and asset return, the sentiment has a poor ability to predict the price, return, and volatility of asset price. Meanwhile, the structural break points of online investor sentiment do not lead to changes in the asset price movement. Based on the empirical mode decomposition of online investor sentiment, we find that high frequency components of online investor sentiment can be used to predict the asset price movement. Thus, the obtained results could be useful for risk supervision and asset portfolio management.},

However, the linear model may lead to misspecification and lack of robustness. We provide statistical evidence that the relationship between stock returns, S BW and S PLS is characterized by structural instability and inherent nonlinearity. Given this, using a nonparametric causality approach, we show that neither S BW nor S PLS predicts stock market returns or even its volatility, as opposed to previous empirical evidence.},

In addition, we find similar results for the three Shari'ah-compliant firm-size portfolios (i.e., large-, medium-, and small-cap). However, this relationship is stronger for harder to arbitrage Shari'ah-compliant stocks; that is, investor sentiment has a greater influence on small-cap equities. Additionally, estimations from the vector autoregressive model confirm the aforementioned results. In terms of volatility, GARCH estimations suggest that bullish shifts in investor sentiment in the current period are accompanied by lower conditional volatility in the ensuing period.

Journal of Empirical Economics 49 (3): 307-343], we suggest that media pessimism has an effect on market performance after a lag of several months. We construct a monthly media pessimism indicator by taking the ratio of the number of newspaper articles that contain predetermined negative words to the number of newspaper articles that contain predetermined positive words in the headline and in the lead paragraph. Our results indicate that media pessimism is associated with negative (positive) market returns 14-17 (24-25) months in advance and positive market volatilities 1-20 months in advance. Our results are statistically and economically significant. We find evidence for Granger causality of media pessimism on market performance. Our media pessimism indicator possesses additional predictive power for the Baker and Wurgler [2006. "Investor Sentiment and the Cross-section of Stock Returns."

To test this, we analyzed all the data collected over a 3-month period in 2011 from Tencent Weibo (one of the largest microblogging websites in China). We designed a social influence (SI)-based Tencent finance-related moods model to simulate investors' irrational behaviors, and designed a Tencent Moods-based Stock Trend Analysis (TM\_STA) model to detect correlations between Tencent moods and the Hushen-300 index (one of the most important financial indexes in China). Experimental results show that the proposed method can help explain the data fluctuation. The findings support the existing behavioral financial theory, and can help to understand short-term rises and falls in a stock market.

We then compare the effects of uncertainty on economic activity when the UCI is used instead of individual uncertainty proxies in structural VAR models. The interest of our UCI is to synthesize theses effects within one measure of uncertainty. Overall, the UCI was able to account for the most important dynamics of uncertainty which play an important role in business cycles.},

We evaluate the NCI using financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and finance-related news. We hypothesise that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets.

We also found significant differences between newspapers in their interpretation of the crisis, with the Financial Times being significantly pessimistic even in phases of low market volatility. Our results confirm the reflexive nature of stock markets.

The estimated coefficient of country-specific consumer confidence index used as a proxy for investor sentiment is statistically significant and negative for France and Germany, but statistically significant and positive for Ireland alone. The results provide evidence that in France and Germany, stock market volatility is sensitive to negative shock in investor sentiment, supporting the existence of the leverage effect; in Ireland, however, no such sensitivity exists. The results of this study should be of a particular interest for both domestic and international investors, academic researchers and policymakers in terms of international portfolio diversification. Investors can potentially improve their portfolio performance by considering investor sentiment, while policymakers can take steps to stabilize investor sentiment, thereby reducing stock market volatility and uncertainty.},

Thus, as correlations increase between equity, bonds and commodities, a new strand of research questions the benefits of home-grown diversification using volatility products. First we ask: "What expected returns will induce equity and bond investors to perceive ex-ante diversification benefits from adding volatility?" We call this the optimal diversification threshold. We derive the theoretical thresholds for minimum-variance, mean-variance and Black-Litterman optimization. Empirical analysis of US and European markets shows that volatility diversification is frequently perceived to be optimal, ex-ante, but these apparent benefits are almost never realized, being eroded by high roll and transaction costs. Exchange-traded volatility only proved an effective diversifier during the banking crisis. At other times long equity and bond portfolios diversified with volatility futures have not performed as well as those without diversification, or even those diversified with commodities.},

Our results suggest that the use of t-student Markov Switching Component ARCH Model (MS-ARCH) models is appropriate for active trading in the cocoa futures and the Gaussian MS-GARCH is appropriate for sugar. For the specific case of the coffee market, we did not find evidence in favor of the use of MS-GARCH models. This is so by the fact that the trading algorithm led to inaccurate trading signs.

	abstract = {In this paper we tested, with a two-regime Gaussian Markov-switching model, the weekly performance of the euro valued MSCI EMU index and the MSCI EMU indices that exclude each country member. We did this in order to test the long-term market integration and to identify potential short-term opportunities for active portfolio management activities. Our results suggest that even if the EMU stock markets are integrated in the long-term, when we filter the data in two regimes (one for normal time periods and another for crisis ones) we found strong evidence in favor of active portfolio management activities by potentially increasing the portfolio performance if we exclude Finland, Italy, Spain and Portugal in normal time periods and Italy, Spain, France and Finland in the crisis ones. This last result is of interest because France is the second biggest EMU economy and, as Finland, is not considered a "peripheral" country.},

By assuming that a given investor lives in a two-regime world (with low- and high-volatility time periods), a trading algorithm was simulated (from January 2000 to March 2019), which helped the investor to forecast the probability of being in the high-volatility regime at t ? 1. Once this probability was known, the investor could decide to invest either in commodities, during low-volatility periods or in the 3-month US Treasury bills, during high-volatility periods. Our results suggest that the Gaussian MS-GARCH model is the most appropriate to generate alpha or extra returns (from a passive investment strategy) in the corn market and the t-Student MS-GARCH is the best one for soybean trading.},

Consequently, the investigation found that there is a permanent causal relationship running from the VIX toward the RISE index.

We show that an uninformed utility-maximizing investor, with a feasible level of risk aversion and reasonable portfolio exposure constraints, can use VIX futures to significantly improve his optimal reference portfolio comprised of a monetary asset, equities, corporate and government bonds. We find also that VIX futures provide significant improvement over hedge funds and commodities.

Journal of Empirical Economics 49 (3): 307-343], we suggest that media pessimism has an effect on market performance after a lag of several months. We construct a monthly media pessimism indicator by taking the ratio of the number of newspaper articles that contain predetermined negative words to the number of newspaper articles that contain predetermined positive words in the headline and in the lead paragraph. Our results indicate that media pessimism is associated with negative (positive) market returns 14-17 (24-25) months in advance and positive market volatilities 1-20 months in advance. Our results are statistically and economically significant. We find evidence for Granger causality of media pessimism on market performance. Our media pessimism indicator possesses additional predictive power for the Baker and Wurgler [2006. "Investor Sentiment and the Cross-section of Stock Returns."

However, contrary to the notion of diversification, MV approach often leads to portfolios highly concentrated on a few assets. Also, this method leads to poor out-of-sample performances. Entropy is a well-known measure of diversity and also has a shrinkage interpretation. In this article, we propose to use cross-entropy measure as the objective function with side conditions coming from the mean and variance-covariance matrix of the resampled asset returns. This automatically captures the degree of imprecision of input estimates. Our approach can be viewed as a shrinkage estimation of portfolio weights (probabilities) which are shrunk towards the predetermined portfolio, for example, equally weighted portfolio or minimum variance portfolio.

Assumptions for our simulations included the following: (1) we assumed that the investors trade in a homogeneous (Gaussian or t-Student) two regime context and (2) the investor used a time-fixed, ARCH, or GARCH variance in each regime.

(2) MLE and MIVQUE perform better than the ANOVA methods in the estimation of the individual variance component, especially for severely unbalanced patterns and large variance component ratio. However, for the remainder variance component, there is nothing much to choose among these methods. (3) Better estimates of the variance components do not necessarily imply better estimates of the regression coefficients.

By backtesting the performance of a U.S. dollar based investor, we found that the use of the Gaussian MS-GARCH leads, in the Brazilian market, to a better performance against a buy and hold strategy (BH). In addition, we found that the use of t-Student MS-ARCH models is preferable in the Chilean market. Lastly, in the Mexican case, we found that is better to use Gaussian time-fixed variance MS models. Their use leads to the best overall performance than the BH portfolio. Our results are of use for practitioners by the fact that MS-GARCH models could be part of quantitative and computer algorithms for active trading in these three stock markets.},

It is designed to be used where there are a large number of time series to be forecast. However, a bootstrap version of the EIC can be used where there is a single time series to be forecast. The EIC provides a data-driven model selection tool that can be tuned to the particular forecasting task. We compare the EIC with other model selection criteria including Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The comparisons show that for the M3 forecasting competition data, the EIC outperforms both the AIC and BIC, particularly for longer forecast horizons. We also compare the criteria on simulated data and find that the EIC does better than existing criteria in that case also.},

	volume = {52},
	doi = {10.1007/s00181-016-1069-5},
	abstract = {Forecasting oil prices is not straightforward, such that it is convenient to build a confidence interval around the forecasted prices. To this end, the principal ingredient for obtaining a reliable crude oil confidence interval is its volatility. Moreover , accurate crude oil volatility estimation has fundamental implications in terms of risk management, asset pricing and portfolio handling. Generally, current studies consider volatility models based on lagged crude oil price realizations and, at most, one additional macroeconomic variable as crude oil determinant. This paper aims to fill this gap, jointly considering not only traditional crude oil driving forces, such as the aggregate demand and oil supply, but also the monetary policy rate. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the debate concerning the potential impact of (lagged) US monetary policy as well as the other crude oil future price (COFP) determinants on daily COFP volatility. By means of the recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling model, different proxies of the US monetary policy alongside US industrial production (proxy of the US aggregate demand) and oil supply are included in the COFP volatility equation. Strong evidence that an expansionary (restrictive) variation in monetary policy anticipates a positive (negative) variation in COFP volatility is found. We also find that a negative (pos-itive) variation of industrial production increases (decreases) COFP volatility. This means that volatility behaves counter-cyclically, according to the literature.

Hence, forecasting bear markets is important for investors, policymak-ers, and economic agents in general. In our two-step procedure, we first identify stock market regimes in the US using three different techniques (Markov-switching models, dating rules, and a na¨ıvena¨ıve moving average). Second, we predict recessions in the S\&P 500 with the help of several modeling approaches, utilizing the information of 92 macro-financial variables. Our results suggest that several variables are suitable for forecasting recessions in stock markets in-sample and out-of-sample. Our early warning models for the US equity market, in particular those using principal components to aggregate the information in the macro-financial variables, provide a statistical improvement over several benchmarks. In addition, these generate economic value by boosting returns, improving the sharp ratio and the omega, and substantially reducing drawdowns. JEL Codes: C53; G11; G17.},

We find only weak evidence that superior corporate social performance (CSP) results in systematically reduced credit risk. However, we do find strong support for our hypothesis that a country’s ESG performance moderates the CSP–credit risk relationship. Superior CSP is regarded as risk-reducing and rewarded with better ratings and lower z-spreads only if it is recognized by the environment. In addition, we find a reduction of corporate bonds’ z-spreads by approx. 9.64 basis points if the CSP of a company mirrors the ESG performance of the country it is located in.},

	abstract = {Identifying and dating explosive bubbles when there is periodically collapsing behavior over time has been a major concern in the economics literature and is of great importance for practitioners. The complexity of the nonlinear structure inherent in multiple bubble phenomena within the same sample period makes econometric analysis particularly difficult. The present paper develops new recursive procedures for practical implementation and surveillance strategies that may be employed by central banks and fiscal regulators. We show how the testing procedure and dating algorithm of Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011, PWY) are affected by multiple bubbles and may fail to be consistent. The present paper proposes a generalized version of the sup ADF test of PWY to address this difficulty, derives its asymptotic distribution, introduces a new date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles, and proves consistency of this dating procedure. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. Empirical applications are conducted to S\&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach identifies many key historical episodes of exuberance and collapse over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and the CUSUM procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

In total, 60 employees from 19 investment insti- tutions, 453 private investors and 71 institutional investors participated in a questionnaire study. While socially responsible investment (SRI) among private and institutional investors was guided by self-transcendent values (environmental and social values), this was not the case among fund managers working in investment institutions. Fund managers in invest- ment institutions were affected by beliefs about long-term returns of SRI. Private investors were, in addition, infl uenced by beliefs about long-term returns, whereas institutional inves- tors were motivated by an effort to reduce fi nancial risks. Finally, investment institutions tended to overrate the importance of fi nancial returns among their benefi ciaries (private and institutional benefi ciaries) and underestimate the importance of ethical, environmental and social aspects for benefi ciaries. The results indicate that private and institutional inves- tors/benefi ciaries give a wider interpretation of fi duciary duty than investment institutions do.},

Zero cost portfolios created by shorting the SRI index and using the proceeds to invest in the conventional index generate higher average returns, lower variance and higher skewness than either of the two indices standing alone.

To ensure comparability, the model is constructed analogously to the early warning system for the US stock market presented by Hauptmann et al. (2014). Based on the time series of discrete monthly returns of the Nikkei 225 and the EuroStoxx 50, filtered probabilities are estimated by two successive Markov-switching models with two regimes each. The market is thus separated in three states: calm, turbulent positive and turbulent negative. Subsequently, a forecasting model using logistic regression and economic input factors is selected. In an empirical asset management case study it is illustrated that the investment performance is improved when considering the signals of the established warning system. Moreover, the US, Asian and European model are compared and interdependencies are highlited.},

Two new concepts of PPP are defined that allow for real exchange behaviour to switch between stationary and non-stationary regimes (partial PPP) or between stationary regimes of differing degrees of persistence (varied PPP). The results indicate that each country is characterized by at least one stationary regime. Indeed, five countries are characterized by two such regimes. Further analysis indicates that the Asian crisis of 1997 gave mixed impetus to the achievement of long-run PPP},

We argue that this is due to the high per- sistence of shocks in GARCH forecasts. To obtain more flexibility regarding volatility persistence, this paper generalizes the GARCH model by distin- guishing two regimes with different volatility levels; GARCH effects are al- lowed within each regime. The resulting Markov regime-switching GARCH model improves on existing variants, for instance by making multi-period- ahead volatility forecasting a convenient recursive procedure. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the model resolves the problem with the high single-regime GARCH forecasts and that it yields significantly better out- of-sample volatility forecasts.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversies and firm market value. We use a unique dataset of more than 4000 firms from 58 countries during 2002-2011. Primary analysis surprisingly shows that ESG controversies are associated with greater firm value. However, when interacted with the corporate social performance (CSP) score, ESG controversies are found to have no direct effect on firm value while the interaction appears to be highly and significantly positive. Building on this evidence, we attempt to explore the channels through which CSP may enhance market value. Conducting sample split analysis indicates that higher CSP score has an impact on market value only for high-attention firms, those firms which are larger, perform better, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and have an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, our findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP.},

Autonomous CSR appears to have more to recommend it.

The two dimensions are compliance/noncompliance with society’s minimal expectations (the law) and involvement/noninvolvement in praiseworthy or supererogatory behavior (philanthropic contributions). In this study, four groups of corporations are identified: “saints” (no crimes, high contributions); “pharisees” (no crimes, low contributions); “cynics/repenters” (crimes, high contributions); and “sinners” (crimes, low contributions). A survey of industry experts reveals that the saints and the cynics/repenters groups were rated significantly higher on CSR than the other two groups. Firms in the sinners group performed significantly poorer than the other three groups on two five-year financial performance measures. These results have important implications for the debate over the relationship between CSR and financial performance. © 1987, The Regents of the University of California. All rights reserved.},

The items considered have been drawn from literature and from corporate reporting and websites of banks and then subjected to content analysis. The model, applied to a sample of European banks, was divided into four areas of analysis (Disclosure; Organization and Management; Offer of Socially Responsible Instruments; International Agreements, Certifications and Indexes) to identify the most frequent ethical conducts and the ones that require improvement measures. Our research highlights that banks pay more attention to the offer of socially responsible instruments and organization and management issues. On the contrary, the banks examined could enhance their socially responsible approach by reinforcing disclosure on Corporate Social Responsibility. In particular, there is a modest orientation towards disclosure on the basis of the triple bottom-line approach. Finally, as for international agreements, certifications and indexes, improvement actions are still needed: there are still many international principles which have not yet been adhered to and an increase in requests for more ethical/quality certifications and inclusion in reputational ratings would be desirable.},

Based on insights we gained from observation at an Asian SRI industry association, interviews with SRI professionals in the U.S. and Europe, and other fieldwork, we questioned explanations for SRI's conflicted relationship with the financial logic. Our observations prompted us to build a panel database of SRI fund foundings from 1970 to 2014 in 19 countries so that we could examine how a dominant logic interacts with alternative logics to promote or stifle institutional change. We decomposed the financial logic into interdependent dimensions as the provider of means (resources, practices, and knowledge) for novel financial ventures to be founded and the enforcer of profit-maximizing ends that constrain such found-ings. Our theory suggests a paradoxical role for the financial logic, which explains an intriguing empirical finding: the founding of SRI funds has a curvi-linear, inverted-U-shaped relationship with the prevalence of the financial logic. We propose and find that the relationship between the dominant financial logic and the social logic of SRI shifts from complementary to competing as the financial logic becomes more prevalent in society and its profit-maximizing end becomes taken for granted. We examined how certain alternative logics-those of unions, religion, and green political parties-moderate these effects. Our results shed light on how and to what extent institutional change can occur in fields in which one institutional logic is dominant. They also reveal country-level institutional factors that drive SRI.},

	doi = {10.1108/MEQ-03-2017-0033},
	abstract = {Purpose: The ESG factor, which consists of environmental, social, and governance factors, represents the non-financial performance of a company. United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment invites investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating the performance of any company. Moreover, nowadays, the contribution of corporations towards sustainable development is a major concern of investors, creditors, government, and other environmental agencies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public-limited companies (PLC) in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 54 companies are selected from Bloomberg’s ESG database that has complete ESG and financial data from 2010 to 2013. This study conducted panel data regressions such as the pooled OLS, fixed effect, and random effect. Findings: Based on the regression results, there is no significant relationship between individual and combined factors of ESG and firm profitability (i.e. ROE) as well as firm value (i.e. Tobin’s Q). Moreover, individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant with the cost of capital (weighted average cost of capital, WACC), but the combined score of ESG positively and significantly influences the cost of capital (WACC) of a company. Practical implications: As this is a new study on Malaysia, the findings of this study will be useful to investors, SRI analysts, policy makers, and other related agencies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first empirical study to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian PLC in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.},

Yet CSR's halo on consumer behavior may extend beyond product evaluations, into nonroutine types of judgments such as attributions. We examine the possibility that the CSR halo affects consumers' attributions in a product-harm crisis situation. In two studies that employ experimental manipulations of prior CSR on a sample of consumers, we examine whether attributions that are influenced by CSR mediate the impact of product-harm crises on consumers' brand evaluations. The results of Study 1 support the hypothesis. Study 2 introduces a boundary condition on the results of Study 1, showing that mediation effects are only found for consumers that are CSR-sensitive. The findings point to a role of CSR in consumer behavior that is more complex than previously conceptualized. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Managers, concerned with restoring competitiveness of their firms, are abandoning traditional approaches to strategy; they are searching for new approaches that give guidance in a turbulent environment. Many academics, confronted with the same reality, are reexamining the relevance of the concepts and tools of the strategy field. In the absence of a consistent and useful strategy paradigm that they can use, managers appear to have embraced attention to ‘implementation’ as their saviour, more or less abandoning strategy as either unimportant or uninteresting. Academics continue to search for new approaches.

The results show that banks’ IT investments have a significant positive impact on the adoption of financial digitalization by customers. Banks’ IT investments also increase the likelihood that bank customers undertake their financial transactions through digital channels rather than in the physical branch.

Considerable abnormal returns are available from holding a portfolio of the socially least desirable stocks. These relationships between social and financial performance can be rationalized by multi-factor models for explaining the cross-sectional variation in returns, but not by industry effects.},

The results suggest that companies in sensitive industries present superior environmental performance, even when controlling for the firm's size and country.

This article presents a new "Stakeholder View" of the firm which holds that stakeholder relationships are the ultimate sources of the firm's wealth-creating capacity. According to this view, long-term business success requires a firm to develop and integrate relationships with its multiple stakeholders within a comprehensive management strategy. In order to illustrate the validity of this approach, this article describes and analyzes the evolution and impact of comprehensive stakeholder management policies in three major firms.},

Using a Markov-switching VAR with time-varying transition probabilities, we analyse the transmission of shocks across the financial system. We find little evidence of asset correlation changes between normal and crisis regimes and those that do occur are predominantly associated with liquidity variables. Otherwise, relationships are stable across market conditions, implying that the U.S. financial crisis was due to cross-market interdependencies rather than contagion. There is limited evidence that the deteriorating quality of the underlying assets can explain the transition from 'normal' market conditions to a high-volatility regime, although this is not consistent across model specifications.},

A remaining concern about SROI is that we do not yet know if SROI itself adds sufficient benefit to programs to justify its cost. Two frameworks for this proposed metaevaluation of SROI are suggested, the first comparing benefits to costs summatively (the resource→outcome model). The second framework evaluates costs and benefits according to how much they contribute to or are caused by the different activities of SROI. This resource→activity→outcome model could enable outcomes of SROI to be maximized within resource constraints (such as budget and time limits) on SROI. Alternatively, information from this model could help minimize the costs of achieving a specific level of return on investment from conducting SROI. Possible problems with this metaevaluation of SROI are discussed.},

	abstract = {A flamelet model implementation consists of two steps: the generation of a set of lami-nar flamelet solutions and the integration of the laminar flamelet solutions with presumed shape probability density functions (PDFs) to produce a flamelet table for turbulent flame simulations. Many studies have been done in the past to examine the effect of different flamelet modeling strategies including the effect of employing different laminar flamelet solutions for the modeling. However, little work has been done to examine the effect of different presumed PDF table integration approaches on different flamelet model predictions. This work aims at investigating the source of errors arising from the flamelet table integration. The flamelet/progress variable model is chosen as a representative flamelet model, and three different presumed PDF table integration approaches are compared to examine the effect of table integration on flamelet model predictions. A laboratory-scale turbulent non-premixed jet flame (Sandia flame D) is chosen as a test case for the examination. In general, some evident sensitivity of the modeling results to the different flamelet table integration approaches is observed. The underlying reasons for the performance difference of different approaches are explored, and it is found that a model that preserves the one-dimensional laminar flamelet structure during the presumed-PDF table integration can improve the model prediction accuracy. Different sources of errors involved in flamelet model implementation are investigated, including numerical integration errors, flamelet table errors, and the errors in the predictions of the flamelet independent variables.},

Second, the proposed chaotic efficient bat algorithm, based on the chaotic, niche search, and evolution mechanisms, is used to optimize the parameters of the hybrid kernel-based support vector regression model. Third, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm is utilized to decompose the original floating platform motion time series into a series of intrinsic mode functions and residuals. The ultimate forecasting results are obtained by summing the outputs of these functions. Subsequently, motion data for a real floating platform are used to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The sample used includes ESG data of ASSET4, Bloomberg and KLD for the U.S. market from 1991 to 2012. The econometrical framework applies an ESG portfolio approach using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model as well as cross-sectional Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. Previous empirical research indicates a relationship between ESG ratings and returns. As against this, the ESG portfolios do not state a significant return difference between companies with high and low ESG ratings. Although the Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions reveal a significant influence of several ESG variables, investors are hardly able to exploit this relationship. The magnitude and direction of the impact are substantially dependent on the rating provider, the company sample and the particular subperiod. The results suggest that investors should no longer expect abnormal returns by trading a difference portfolio of high and low rated firms with regard to ESG aspects.},

While the levels of these series contain slow moving information for predicting long horizon returns, they typically provide poor short horizon forecasts. Using three approaches to extract the ratios cyclical component, we conduct several in-and out-of-sample tests. In-sample estimation using the cyclical component leads to economically sensible values, as well as an improved fit compared to the ratio level results. Out-of-sample evidence reveals forecast improvement over a historical mean model, although this varies according to the metric used. The historical mean model is preferred using mean absolute and squared error measures, but the predictive models perform better using Mincer-Zarnowitz and encompassing regressions. Using economic based forecast evaluation, the predictive models are clearly preferred, with a stronger ability to predict the future direction of return movements and with higher trading returns. A further examination of the results reveal that this greater performance largely arises from a superior ability to predict future negative returns.},

By using high-frequency realised volatility and bi-power volatility estimators in the heterogeneous autoregressive model, the IPC Mexican market was found to be in concordance with the investment structure suggested by the heterogeneous market hypothesis. Besides various volatility estimators, the heterogeneous autoregressive model was improved with the enhancement of autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effect to capture the volatility of the realised volatility. To obtain a better forecast, the combination forecasts were applied by using various averaging methods and the forecast evaluations were examined by using various forecast loss functions. Finally, the forecasted results were utilised in determining the Mexican IPC stock market risk via the value-at-risk based on normal and heavy-tailed distributions.},

	doi = {10.3390/risks7010015},
	abstract = {‘Sustainable investment’—includes a variety of asset classes selected while caring for the causes of environmental, social, and governance (ESG). It is an investment strategy that seeks to combine social and/ or environmental benefits with financial returns, thus linking investor’s social, ethical, ecological and economic concerns Under certain conditions, these indices also help to attract foreign capital, seeking international participation in the local capital markets. The purpose of this paper is to study whether the sustainable investment alternatives offer better financial returns than the conventional indices from both developed and emerging markets. With an intent to maintain consistency, this paper comparatively analyzes the financial returns of the Thomson Reuters/S-Network global indices, namely the developed markets (excluding US) ESG index—TRESGDX, emerging markets ESG index—TRESGEX, US large-cap ESG index—TRESGUS, Europe ESG index— TRESGEU, and those of the usual markets, namely MSCI world index (MSCI W), MSCI All Country World Equity index (MSCI ACWI), MSCI USA index (MSCI USA), and MSCI Europe Australasia Far East index (MSCI EAFE), MSCI Emerging Markets index (MSCI EM) and MSCI Europe index (MSCI EU). The study also focusses on the inter-linkages between these indices. Daily closing prices of all the benchmark indices are taken for the five-year period of January 2013–December 2017. Line charts and unit-root tests are applied to check the stationary nature of the series; Granger’s causality model, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)-GARCH type modelling is performed to find out the linkages between the markets under study followed by the Johansen’s cointegration test and the Vector Error Correction Model to test the volatility spillover between the sustainable indices and the conventional indices. The study finds that the sustainable indices and the conventional indices are integrated and there is a flow of information between the two investment avenues. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the performance between sustainable indices and the traditional conventional indices, being a good substitute to the latter. Hence, the financial/investment managers can obtain more insights regarding investment decisions, and the study further suggests that their portfolios should consider both the indices with the perspective of diversifying the risk and hedging, and reap benefits of the same. Additionally, corporate executives shall use it to benchmark their own performance against peers and track news as well.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In our model all countries grow at the same steady-state rate, with each country's productivity ranking determined by how rapidly it adopts ideas. Research effort is determined by how much ideas earn at home and abroad. Patents affect the return to ideas. We relate the decision to patent an invention internationally to the cost of patenting in a country and to the expected value of patent protection in that country. We can thus infer the direction and magnitude of the international diffusion of technology from data on international patenting, productivity, and research. We fit the model to data from the five leading research economies. A rough summary of our findings is that the world lies about two-thirds of the way from an extreme of technological autarky to an extreme of free trade in ideas. Research performed abroad is about two-thirds as potent as domestic research. Together the United States and Japan drive at least two-thirds of the growth in each of the countries in our sample.},

We extended these reviews by using a non-parametric multivariate equality test, along with a multi-factor market cap model, and a Monte Carlo simulation. Our results show that the IPCS index, the IPCcomp and the IPC have a statistically equal mean-variance performance, suggesting that this sort of investment style (SRI) is a good substitute of the broad market investment style in the long term. Among the causes of this finding is the fact that the IPCS and the IPCcomp indexes have almost the same large and small cap stock concentration and the IPC index (a large-cap one) is not as diversified and mean-variance efficient as the former. ©},

For this purpose six markets KSE100 (Karachi, Pakistan), BSE Sensex (Mumbai, India), NIKKEI 225 (Tokyo, Japan), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) (Shanghai, China) and KOSPI (Seoul, South Korea) were considered. Stock market indices comprise of daily data from the period January 2002 to December 2009. The graphical representation of time series shows the preliminary examination of stock behaviors. The analysis shows the high correlation and heteroskedastic trend (volatility) among the stock markets in selected time period. After preliminary analysis the formal descriptive method of mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation have been applied for measuring and ranking purposes. The results show that KOSPI has the highest average annual return of 12.67\% and followed by BSE with 11.61\%, whereas, KSE 100 has the least annual average returns of 9.31\%. The highest volatility coefficient of 3.097 has been observed in Hang Seng (Hong Kong) followed by 2.87 in Nikkei (Tokyo). However, the KSE 100 observed the lowest volatility coefficient of 2.078. Bartlett’s test is applied for the inferential analysis to investigate whether the equality of volatility is the same in each market return. Finally, GARCH (1, 1) model is applied which concludes a significant ARCH (1) and GARCH (1) effects and confirms all markets’ returns are statistically significant since p \&amp;lt; 0.01 and their Long Run Average Variances (LRAV) range from 1.52\% to 2.54\% for KSE100 Index and Shanghai Stock Exchange respectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The present article analyses the alternations in the causality in the financial markets during the 2008–2009 financial crisis with a clear focus on the changes and developments in the financial markets of the Baltic States and Russia in the period starting from 2008. The authors have advanced a hypothesis that the research methods of trends of an abrupt plunge and subsequent stabilistation of equity prices that were clearly discernable during the 1987 crisis are also pointfull for the current financial crisis. The present research was conducted on the basis of the following assumptions: both crises affected financial markets of several nations; a characteristic feature for the inception of the crises is an abrupt fall in equity prices; indications of stabilisation in financial markets become observable before financial experts conclude the end of the financial crisis. To confirm the hypothesis on the similarities of the general trends during the two major international financial crisis, the authors employed empiric tests developed on the basis of Granger causality tests. Based on the precedent survey of the financial crisis of 1987 (Malliaris and Urrutia 1992), the authors of the present article chose to use the Granger causality testing methodology. To be able to apply the Granger causality test first it was necessary to verify the degree of cointegration of the indices of the main equity markets in each of the country (OMX Vilnius, OMX Riga, OMX Tallinn, RTS). For that purpose the authors used the Dickey‐Fuller and Johansen testing methodology. Both methodologies demonstrated a strong cointegration between the changes in the indices of all equity markets irrespective of the period analysed (i.e., pre‐crisis, during the crisis, post‐crisis). In all cases the T‐statistics exceeded the critical value. The strongest cointegration was observable in the crisis period, and the weakest – after the crisis. The results showed that in view of the financial crisis the Latvian market showed the greatest degree of slow‐down despite it being most active in the pre‐crisis times, likewise, Estonian market also showed a somewhat higher degree of passiveness. Thus, it was the Latvian and Estonian markets that the financial downturn had the most painful impacts upon. While the Lithuanian and the Russian markets were, on the contrary, much more active and therefore outlived the equity crash period with least painful after‐effects, thus producing confirmation that in the face of a crisis the interests and expectations of most investors are largely related to major markets normally viewed as more reliable and showing a higher degree of resilience. Santrauka Straipsnyje analizuojami finansų rinkų priežastingumo pokyčiai 2008–2009 m. finansinės krizės laikotarpiu. Pagrindinis dėmesys sutelkiamas į Baltijos šalių– Lietuvos, Latvijos ir Estijos – bei Rusijos akcijų rinkų pokyčius nuo 2008 m. Autoriai iškelia hipotezę, kad finansų rinkose staigaus akcijų kainų kritimo ir jų stabilizavimosi tendencijos, kurios išryškejo nuo 1987 m. prasidėjusios krizės, būdingos dabartinei finansinei krizei. Tyrimo metu daromos prielaidos: abi krizės apima daugelio valstybių finansų rinkas; krizių pradžiai būdingas staigus akcijų kainų kritimas; finansų rinkų stabilizavimosi požymiai pastebimi anksčiau, nei ekspertai konstatuoja krizės pabaigą. Dviejų tarptautinių finansų rinkų krizių bendrųjų tendencijų panašumo hipotezei patvirtinti naudoti empiriniai testai, parengti remiantis Granger priežastiniais testais: Granger priežastiniai testai ir kointegracijos testai. Nustatyta, kad finansinės krizės metu Latvijos rinka tapo pasyviausia, nors iki prasidedant krizei buvo pati aktyviausia, pasyvesne tapo ir Estijos rinka. Taigi finansinis nuosmukis skaudžiausiai paveikė Latvijos ir Estijos finansų rinkas. Lietuvos ir Rusijos rinkos krizės metu tapo pačios aktyviausios ir lengviausiai išgyveno akcijų kainų kritimo perioda, tuo patvirtindamos, kad krizės metu daugelio investuotojų interesai ir lūkesčiai paprastai siejami su didesnemis rinkomis, kurios laikomos patikimesnėmis ir turinčiomis galimybę greičiau atsigauti.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Regression models are constructed using quarterly time series of 2000–2011 years while the methodology is backed with the findings of Lithuanian and foreign scientists from an extensive overview of specific literature. Regression equations, obtained in the paper, allows us to identify the key macroeconomic and global indicators that statistically significantly affect the Baltic securities market and to quantify their impact on the stock price indices of individual sectors in the Baltic countries. Econometric analysis of OMX Baltic security market proves the hypothesis that the set of macroeconomic regressors may vary considerably depending on the individual sector's price indices, especially in the case of small open economy with immature stock markets. The paper provides investors who are shaping their portfolios taking into account the macroeconomic forecasts with additional opportunities on the basis of sectoral stock price indices regression equations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Classifiers were trained and tested on randomly drown samples and on four different databases built starting from the initial financial indicators.

Our primary resource in developing, constructing, and maintaining the ratings is ASSET4, a Thomson Reuters business that provides objective, relevant and systematic environmental, social and governance (ESG) information based on 250+ key performance indicators (KPIs) and 750+ individual data points along with their original data sources. Since its founding in 2003 and acquisition in 2009, Asset4 has been recognized globally as a premier source of ESG data. More than 100 analysts use their experience to collect relevant, comparable (companies often report in different units, scopes and formats) and up-to-date information utilizing publicly available sources (e.g. annual reports, NGO websites, CSR reports). Asset4 classifies these data into categories within each major pillar. The Thomson Reuters Corporate Responsibility Ratings follow this convention in data aggregations. For example, the environmental pillar consists of three category groupings: emission reduction, product innovation, and resource reduction. The governance pillar has five categories: board functions, board structure, compensation policy, shareholders policy, and vision-and-strategy. The social pillar is the most complex with seven categories: community, diversity, employment quality, health-and-safety, human rights, product responsibility, and training-and-development. Utilizing models we have based upon the primary ESG data underlying the aforementioned 15 categories, we are now able to provide environmental, social, governance and composite ESG ratings and rankings on over 4600 public companies worldwide. This universe is expected to expand by approximately 300 companies per year moving forward.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this paper, we look at the effect of the financial crisis from an angle overlooked to date in the finance literature by investigating composition effects arising from the financial crisis. A composition effect is a change in the mar-ket risk of a sector that is caused not by a direct change in that sector but by a change in another sector that affects the composition of the stock market. In the paper we investigate the pre and during crisis market risk of the in-dustrial, banking and utilities sectors. Amongst other results, we find a positive relationship across the G12 coun-tries between the increase in the market risk of industrials during the crisis and both the pre-crisis market risk of the banking sector and the scale of the systemic crisis in a country. The six G12 countries that experienced a major systematic banking crisis are amongst the seven countries with the largest increases in the market risk for indus-trials. Results drawn from our detailed analysis using US data are consistent with these findings. Finally, we show how the results add to our understanding of the linkages between the financial and real sector and conclude that composition effects of the financial crisis could have a significant chilling effect on investment in industrials, which is in addition to the effect of other linkages already documented.},

On the one hand, financial integration among economies helps to improve their capacity to absorb shocks and foster development. On the other hand, intensified financial linkages in a world of increasing capital mobility may also harbour the risk of cross-border financial contagion. This paper provides a survey of high-frequency indicators to monitor the development of equity market integration in Asia. The results show that after slowing down between 2002 and 2006, the equity market integration process picked up again in 2007–08. Nevertheless, the pro-cess is not complete and the degrees of integration between mature and emerging equity markets are dif-ferent. The divergence may be attributed to the difference in the political, economic and institutional aspects across jurisdictions in Asia.},

In this vein, we contribute to the rich literature on global liquidity in two different ways: on the one hand, to achieve a global series in terms of common monetary policy shocks, we propose a distinction between common and idiosyncratic factors across economies, as proposed by Bai and Ng (2004). Our second innovation stems from the consideration of a Markov-switching vector error correction model when analyzing time-varying short-run dynamics. Having identified the long-run structure which includes a proportional relationship between commodity prices and global liquidity in the first step, our results indeed show that the impact of a global liquidity measure on different commodity prices is significant and varies over time. One regime approximately accounts for times where commodity prices significantly adjust to disequilibria, while the second regime is characterized by either a weak or no commodity price adjustment. The fact that global liquidity also reacts to disequilibria in a specific regime demonstrates the two-way causality between monetary policy and commodity prices.},

Specifically, we allow the cointegrating equation to switch between m states, according to a first-order Markov process. First, we find evidence that regime-switching exists in the relative pricing relationship, and that two is the optimal number of states. Once we control for shifts in the cointegrating vector, we find that natural gas and crude oil prices are cointegrated, and an error correction model (ECM) of their long-term equilibrium relationship is properly specified. This finding broadens the ECM model of their relationship to longer and more varied sample periods. Also, in a direct comparison of the two and one state cointegrating equations , we found evidence of the potential superiority of the two-state equation, in that it may be robust to shifts in the cointegrating vector which are missed by standard tests for a unit root. Further, our analysis finds evidence that natural gas and crude oil prices did not permanently 'decouple' in the early 2000s, but rather experienced a temporary shift in regimes. We find that forecasts of the relative pricing of natural gas and crude oil should be conditioned on state probability.},

Testing parameter constancy is particularly challenging for two reasons. First, some nuisance parameters are not identi…ed under the null hypothesis. Second, the information matrix is singular under the null. As a consequence, standard approaches do not apply. Our test procedure is based on the information matrix equality and has several desirable properties. First, it does not require estimating the model under the alternative.

It is often argued that stock prices are determined by some fundamental macroeconomic variables. Therefore, macroeconomic variables can influence investment decisions and motivates many researchers to investigate the relation between stock market prices and macroeconomic variables. The current paper attempts to introduce the concepts of stock market and macroeconomic indicators, then to present a model of the impact of macroeconomic indicators on stock market index, and to define what macroeconomic indicators are related with stock market index in the short and long runs. The study investigates ten macroeconomic indicators and the main Baltic stock market indices. The data are monthly and extend from the January of 2000 to the December of 2008. Empirical research has been conducted with the Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. With the reference to the results of performed analysis the interpretations of the relationships between macroeconomic indicators and stock market index from the viewpoint of investors have been formed.

Naturally the firms are willing to innovate to leverage on future profits and growth generated by the new products and supported by temporary monopolistic positions on the market. However, the question is about how much the companies should invest to record higher profitability. The authors tried to answer this question analyzing the companies within the Central and Eastern European region taking intangible assets as innovation proxy. It was concluded that the companies having higher investments in the intangible assets are able to generate higher margins. However, positive effect of possibly higher innovation potential is seen only if investments in intangibles are substantial, i.e. over 10\%.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}After the adoption of International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (widely known as Basel II requirements) in 2004 the risk management in commercial banks has changed dramatically. Lithuanian commercial banks are in transitional period now adapting their risk management systems to Basel II requirements. Market risk is considered one of the key risks in bank risk management structure, so proper management of market risk is essential for a modern bank. Currency exchange risk usually is the main component of market risk. Currency exchange risk management in Lithuanian commercial banks was not good enough; also the Central Bank's regulatory limits were liberal. But after the adoption of Basel II requirements, the entire risk management system is transforming and currency exchange risk management is affected. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the transformations of currency exchange in Lithuanian commercial banks and propose an effective model for commercial banking. These transformations are performed in the regulatory system imposed by the Central Bank of Lithuania and through transformations of the bank's internal risk management system moving to internal (usually VaR based) models. VaR models are considered as modern methods for risk management. These models proposed by Central bank or other authorities for internal and statutory risk management in commercial banks. In this article, the proposed variation‐covariation VaR model was tested with real data using the back‐testing method. Back‐testing showed that the proposed model is reliable enough, because the number of mismatches was less than 5 \% in all tested currency pairs during all testing. In most currency pairs mismatches percentage was lower than 3 \%. Back‐testing results confirm that the VaR method is reliable enough for day‐to‐day using by financial institutions and traders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This model allows for dynamic changes in the degree of market integration, regional market risk premium, re-gional exchange-rate risk premium, and domestic market risk premium. Our findings show several interesting facts. First, the time-varying degree of integration in the Singapore market is satisfactorily explained by the level of trade openness and the term premium of US interest rates, which have recently tended to increase, how-ever these markets remain substantially segmented from the world market. Second, the local market risk premi-um is found to explain a significant proportion of the total risk premium for emerging market returns. Our findings illustrate several important implications for portfolio hedgers for making optimal portfolio allocations, engaging in risk management and forecasting future volatility in equity markets. Our results are also of interest for both policymakers and investors, with respect to regional development policies and dedicated portfolio in-vestment strategies in the ASEAN-5 region.},

A stronger form of self-similarity entails not only that this mean absolute value, but also the full distributions of lag-k jumps have a scaling behavior characterized by the above Hurst exponent. In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot showed that cotton prices have such a strong form of (distributional) self-similarity, and for the first time introduced Lévy's stable random variables in the modeling of price records. This paper discusses the analysis of the self-similarity of high-frequency DEM-USD exchange rate records and the 30 main German stock price records. Distributional self-similarity is found in both cases and some of its consequences are discussed.},

The article proceeds with a review of socially responsible investment (SRI) and more recent responsible investment (RI) literature, in the context of growing public awareness (but not necessarily understanding) of the concept of sustainability ("Literature review of SRI field: SRI, RI and sustainable investing" section). It then examines the literature on pension fund governance, arguing the need for more detailed practical guidance for funds moving towards sustainable investing, especially for those implementing a sustainable investing strategy ("Anglo-American pension fund governance" section). It presents the framework for the practical implementation of sustainable investing in the "Sustainable investing framework" section. Finally, we review the relevant Anglo-American legal backdrop, outlining how pension funds adopting our framework should approach their fiduciary obligations, and then discussing potential regulatory enablers of sustainable investment ("Legal context: barriers to and enablers of sustainable investing" section)},

From the theoretical model, we develop an empirical ap-proach to estimate a gravity equation for equity holdings that incorporates the overall covariance structure in a theoretically rig-orous yet tractable manner.

Correlation matrices play an important role in portfolio optimization and in several other quantitative descriptions of asset price dynamics in financial markets.

The hierarchical clustering and other procedures performed on the cor-relation matrix to detect statistically reliable aspects of it are seen as filtering procedures of the correlation matrix. We also discuss a method to associate a hierarchically nested factor model to a hierarchical tree obtained from a correlation matrix.

	doi = {10.1093/rfs/hhi017},
	abstract = {This article solves a realistically calibrated life cycle model of consumption and portfolio choice with non-tradable labor income and borrowing constraints. Since labor income substitutes for riskless asset holdings, the optimal share invested in equities is roughly decreasing over life. We compute a measure of the importance of human capital for investment behavior. We find that ignoring labor income generates large utility costs, while the cost of ignoring only its risk is an order of magnitude smaller, except when we allow for a disastrous labor income shock. Moreover, we study the implications of introducing endogenous borrowing constraints in this incomplete-markets setting. The issue of portfolio choice over the life cycle is encountered by every investor. Popular finance books [e.g., Malkiel (1996)] and financial coun-selors generally give the advice to shift the portfolio composition towards relatively safe assets, such as Treasury bills, and away from risky stocks as the investor grows older and reaches retirement. But what could be the economic justification for doing so? A seminal reference addressing the problem of portfolio choice over the life cycle is Samuelson (1969). The concept of ''businessman's risk'' (i.e., holding risky stocks is only advisable for young businessmen, not for widows) is explored and rejected as invalid. However this conclusion is reached under the assumption of independent and identical distributed of returns and requires frictionless markets and the absence of labor income.},

A data augmented Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for non-linear model estimation is developed to facilitate model estimation. The performance of the cross-sectional heterogeneity model and time-varying heterogeneity model are examined with vehicle crash-injury severity data. The time-varying heterogeneity model (Markov switching random parameters ordered probit) is found to provide the best overall model fit. Two roadway safety states are shown to exist and roadway segments transition between these two states according to Markov transition probabilities.

This paper aims to explore whether air pollution, especially the carbon dioxide emission, would affect the business cycle of the demand for tourism at a popular scenic spot in Taiwan, i.e., the Sun Moon Lake. Macroeconomic variables and additional weather patterns are also considered as potential determinants of the demand for tourism in our Markov regime-switching model. The empirical results serve as evidence that the effects of air pollution and rainfall on the demand for tourism depend significantly on the phases of business cycle, and show that, during the peaks, monthly numbers of tourists traveling at the Sun Moon Lake would fall by 25,725 people as the number of bad-air-quality day increases by one. The finding can provide policymakers an insight into the evaluation of the trade-off between industrial development and environmental protection.},

These models assume that there are two unobserved states of roadway safety, and that roadway entities (road-way segments) can switch between these states over time. The states are distinct, in the sense that in the different states accident frequencies are generated by separate counting processes (by separate Pois-son or negative binomial processes). To demonstrate the applicability of the approach presented herein, two-state Markov switching negative binomial models are estimated using five-year accident frequencies on Indiana interstate highway segments. Bayesian inference methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are used for model estimation. The estimated Markov switching models result in a superior statistical fit relative to the standard (single-state) negative binomial model. It is found that the more frequent state is safer and it is correlated with better weather conditions. The less frequent state is found to be less safe and to be correlated with adverse weather conditions.},

We first block the data by month in order to remove seasonal components and propose a MS-AR model with non-homogeneous autoregressive models to describe daily components. Then we discuss extensions where the hidden Markov chain is also non-stationary to handle seasonal and interannual fluctuations. The different models are fitted using the EM algorithm to a long time series of wind speed measurement on the Island of Ouessant (France). It is shown that the fitted models are interpretable and provide a good description of important properties of the data such as the marginal distributions, the second-order structure or the length of the stormy and calm periods.},

However, the stock market proved volatile, and only rarely could investors gain excess returns when trading in real time. Most investors use technical indicators to time the market. However the use of technical indicators is associated with problems, such as indicator selection, use of conflicting versus similar indicators. Investors thus have difficulty relying on technical indicators to make stock market investment decisions. This research combines Markov decision process and genetic algorithms to propose a new analytical framework and develop a decision support system for devising stock trading strategies. This investigation uses the prediction characteristics and real-time analysis capabilities of the Markov decision process to make timing decisions. The stock selection and capital allocation employ string encoding to express different investment strategies for genetic algorithms. The parallel search capabilities of genetic algorithms are applied to identify the best investment strategy. Additionally, when investors lack sufficient money and stock, the architecture of this study can complete the transaction via credit transactions. The experiments confirm that the model presented in this research can yield higher rewards than other benchmarks.},

The problem is to maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth of a portfolio that contains an option, an underlying stock and a risk-free bond. The difficulty that arises in our setting is finding a way to represent the return of the option by the returns of the stock and the risk-free bond in an incomplete regime-switching market. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a functional operator to generate a sequence of value functions, and then show that the optimal value function is the limit of this sequence. The explicit form of each function in the sequence can be obtained by solving an auxiliary portfolio optimization problem in a single-regime market. And then the original optimal value function can be approximated by taking the limit. Additionally, we can also show that the optimal value function is a solution to a dynamic programming equation, which leads to the explicit forms for the optimal value function and the optimal portfolio process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as long as the current state of the Markov chain is given, it is still optimal for an investor in a multiple-regime market to simply allocate his/her wealth in the same way as in a single-regime market.},

	abstract = {Adding volatility exposure to an equity portfolio offers interesting opportunities for long-term investors. This article discusses the advantages of adding a long volatility strategy for a protection to a global European equity portfolio and to specific equity portfolios based in "core" or "peripheral" countries within the euro zone. A European investor today has the choice of investing in US or European equity volatility. We check whether a long volatility strategy based on VSTOXX futures is better than a strategy based on VIX futures. The benefit of using volatility strategies as a hedge for equities is shown through a Mean/Modified-CVaR portfolio optimization. We find that long volatility strategies offer valuable protection to all European equity investors. A long volatility strategy based on VSTOXX futures offers better protection than a similar one based on VIX futures. It reduces the risk of an equity portfolio more significantly, while providing more attractive returns. For specific European investors, and despite major differences in local European equity markets, our long volatility strategy shows a certain homogeneity and provides efficient protection, whatever the country.},

The relationship between the variables in the study was tested through causality and cointegration tests. As a result, the change in the VIX was found to have causality towards the change in the tourism indices of the countries except for the USA and Sri Lanka. In addition, it was found that there was a long-term relationship between the variables and that the increase in VIX caused a decrease in the return of tourism indices.

Determining the number of hidden regimes in such models is a key problem in applications. This paper proposes a strongly consistent estimator of the number of regimes for Markov-switching autoregressive models. By using subadditive ergodic theorem, law of iterated logarithm for martin-gales, together with results from information theory, we derive sufficient conditions to avoid underestimation as well as overestimation. In particular, we propose a modified information criterion, regime-switching information criterion (RSIC) which generates a simple and consistent model selection procedure. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the efficacy of our procedure in finite sample and also compare the performance of RSIC with popular information criteria including AIC, BIC and HQC.

We use daily log-return data from the Standard \& Poor's 500 (S\&P 500) index for the period 1950-2016. The analysis of the S\&P 500 is useful, for example, for investors of (i) well-diversified US equity portfolios; (ii) S\&P 500 futures and options traded at Chicago Mercantile Exchange Globex; (iii) exchange traded funds (ETFs) related to the S\&P 500. The new MS DCS-EGARCH models are alternatives to of the recent MS Beta-t-EGARCH model that uses the symmetric Student's t distribution for the error term. For the new models, we use more flexible asymmetric probability distributions for the error term: Skew-Gent (skewed generalized t), EGB2 (exponential generalized beta of the second kind) and NIG (normal-inverse Gaussian) distributions. For all MS DCS-EGARCH models, we identify high-and low-volatility periods for the S\&P 500. We find that the statistical performance of the new MS DCS-EGARCH models is superior to that of the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model. As a practical application, we perform systematic risk analysis by forecasting VaR and ES.

To understand the extent and nature of the impact of US policy uncertainty on the economic activities of Mexico, we use an indicator of economic policy uncertainty recently developed by Baker et al. (2016) and apply linear and non-linear structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models with US and Mexican macroeconomic aggregates. Our analysis shows that an increase in the US policy uncertainty leads to a fall in Mexican output (industrial production), price level and policy interest rate. In fact, the contribution of the US uncertainty shock to the Mexican output and interest rate is larger than that of the Mexican uncertainty shock. The findings are robust to various identifications of the SVAR model. We also apply the symmetric impulse response test proposed by Kilian and Vigfusson (2011) and find that the responses of Mexican aggregates are symmetric to positive and negative US uncertainty shocks.},

	abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this study is to develop the dictionary with grammar and multiword structure has to be used in conjunction with sentiment analysis to investigate the relationship between financial news and stock market volatility. Design/methodology/approach-An algorithm has been developed for calculating the sentiment orientation and score of data with added information, and the results of calculation have been integrated to construct an empirical model for calculating stock market volatility. Findings-The experimental results reveal a statistically significant relationship between financial news and stock market volatility. Moreover, positive (negative) news is found to be positively (negatively) correlated with positive stock returns, and the score of added information of the news is positively correlated with stock returns. Model verification and stock market volatility predictions are verified over four time periods (monthly, quarterly, semiannually and annually). The results show that the prediction accuracy of the models approaches 66\% and stock market volatility with a particular trend-predicting effect in specific periods by using moving window evaluation. Research limitations/implications-Only one news source is used and the research period is only two years; thus,futurestudiesshouldincorporateseveraldatasourcesandusealongerperiodtoconductamorein-depthanalysis. Practical implications-Understanding trends in stock market volatility can decrease risk and increase profit from investment. Therefore, individuals or businesses can feasibly engage in investment activities for profit by understanding volatility trends in capital markets. Originality/value-The ability to exploit textual information could potentially increase the quality of the data. Few scholars have applied sentiment analysis in investigating interdisciplinary topics that cover information management technology, accounting and finance. Furthermore, few studies have provided support for structured and unstructured data. In this paper, the efficiency of providing the algorithm, the model and the trend in stock market volatility has been demonstrated.},

In the empirical application with oil, gold and equity data from 1990 to 2010, the conditional t copulas portfolios achieve better performance than those based on more conventional strategies.

Results indicate that survey participants recognized a higher level of priority for the pressures coming from the overall external setting involving values, dominant practices, rules and technologies (landscape and regime) over the internal tourism industry dynamics (niche). Results also show that the top five ranked factors are mainly pertaining to weaknesses (excessive bureaucracy and lack of technology and infrastructure) and threats (social acceptability and lack of long-term planning by governments), which can concretely jeopardize the transition towards a greater sustainability in the investigated area.

	abstract = {With the inevitable rise in human population, resource recovery from waste stream is becoming important for a sustainable economy, conservation of the ecosystem as well as for reducing the dependence on the finite natural resources. In this regard, a bio-based circular economy considers organic wastes and residues as potential resources that can be utilized to supply chemicals, nutrients, and fuels needed by mankind. This review explored the role of aerobic and anaerobic digestion technologies for the advancement of a bio-based circular society. The developed routes within the anaerobic digestion domain, such as the production of biogas and other high-value chemicals (volatile fatty acids) were discussed. The potential to recover important nutrients, such as nitrogen through composting, was also addressed. An emphasis was made on the innovative models for improved economics and process performance, which include co-digestion of various organic solid wastes, recovery of multiple bio-products, and integrated bioprocesses.},

Spent coffee grounds based biorefinery is the emerging aspect promoting circular bioeconomy. The sustainable circular bioeconomy by utilizing SCG is achieved by cascade approaches and the inclusion of many biorefinery approaches to obtain many bio-products. The maximum energy recovery can be obtained by process integration. The economic analysis of the biofuel production from SCG is dependent on the cost of raw material, transportation, the need of labor and energy, oil extraction operations and biofuel production. The inclusion of new products from already established product can minimize the investment cost when related to the production cost. A positive net present value can be achieved via SCG biorefinery which indicates the profitability of the process.},

Indeed, by improving forecast accuracy and precision, this exercise would certainly help firms to anticipate economic fluctuations, thus leading to more profitable business and investment strategies. Yet, how to extract the behavioural component from real market data remains an open question. By using monthly data on the returns of the constituents of the S\&P 500 index, we propose a Bayesian methodology to measure the extent to which market data conform to what is predicted by prospect theory (the behavioural perspective), relative to the (standard) subjective expected utility theory baseline. We document a significant behavioural component that reaches its peaks during recession periods and is correlated to measures of financial volatility, market sentiment and financial stress with expected sign. Moreover, the behavioural component decreases around macroeconomic corporate earnings news, while it reacts positively to the number of surprising announcements.},

These options exhibit upward sloping volatility skew and the shape of the skew is largely independent of the volatility level. To take into account these stylized facts, this article introduces a novel two-factor stochastic volatility model with mean reversion that accounts for stochastic skew consistent with empirical evidence. Importantly, the model is analytically tractable. In this sense, I solve the pricing problem corresponding to standard-start, as well as to forward-start European options through the Fast Fourier Transform. To illustrate the practical performance of the model, I calibrate the model parameters to the quoted prices of European options on the VIX index. The calibration results are fairly good indicating the ability of the model to capture the shape of the implied volatility skew associated with VIX options.},

This paper extends recent studies by endogenising the threshold at which the GEYR switches from being low to being high or vice versa, thus improving the arbitrary nature of the determination of the threshold employed in the extant literature. It is observed that a decision rule for investing in equities or bonds, based on the forecasts from a regime switching model, yields higher average returns with lower variability than a static portfolio containing any combinations of equities and bonds. A closer inspection of the results reveals that the model has power to forecast when investors should steer clear of equities, although the trading profits generated are insufficient to outweigh the associated transaction costs. © 2001 International Institute of Forecasters.},

Estimates obtained in an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity framework indicate the persistence of volatility during spikes in the EPU. More importantly, the lagged values of the policy uncertainty index also contains market-related information to explain the markets' future volatility. Major political and economic events have also contributed positively in that a presidential election contains information to explain various asset classes. Commodities, such as crude oil, gold, corn, and soybean, have been impacted significantly followed by EPU. Moreover, interest rate market volatility has also been moved adversely due to tight monetary policy. The Markov regime switching regression manifests that the implied volatility index (VIX) behaves abruptly in two different regimes followed by EPU.},

We propose an extension of the EM algorithm through the Baum-Welch implementation to estimate our model and filter the hidden state of the Markov chain while using the VIX index to invert the latent volatility state. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we test the convergence of our algorithm and compare it with an approximate likelihood procedure where the volatility state is replaced by the VIX index. We found that our method is more accurate than the approximate procedure. Then, we apply Fourier methods to derive a semi-analytical expression of S\&P500 and VIX option prices, which we calibrate to market data.

In this paper, an online system is proposed in which observed indicators are processed and the results are then interfaced with an advanced alert mechanism that gives out appropriate measures. In particular, two stochastic models, with HMM-modulated parameters switching between liquidity regimes, are integrated to capture the evolutions of the four time series or their transformations.

	abstract = {Stochastic volatility (SV) models are theoretically more attractive than the GARCH type of models as it allows additional randomness. The classical SV models deduce a continuous probability distribution for volatility so that it does not admit a computable likelihood function. The estimation requires the use of Bayesian approach. A recent approach considers discrete stochastic autoregressive volatility models for a bounded and tractable likelihood function. Hence, a maximum likelihood estimation can be achieved. This paper proposes a general approach to link SV models under the physical probability measure, both continuous and discrete types, to their processes under a martingale measure. Doing so enables us to deduce the close-form expression for the VIX forecast for the both SV models and GARCH type models. We then carry out an empirical study to compare the performances of the continuous and discrete SV models using GARCH models as benchmark models.},

Two possible regimes are considered: high volatility and low volatility. The specification ac- counts for deviations from normality and the existence of persistence in the evolution of the VIX index. Since the evolution of the VIX index seems to indicate that its conditional variance is not constant over time, I consider two different versions of the model. In the first one, the vari- ance of the index is a function of the volatility regime, whereas the sec- ond version includes ARCH and GARCH specifications for the condi- tional variance of the index. The empirical results show that the model adjusts quite well to the vola - ti lity regimes corresponding to the VIX index. The information provided by the model may be a useful tool for investment decisions, as well as for hedging purposes regarding the volatility of a certain asset.},

These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new ″down-and-out″ option are derived. Other results.},

	abstract = {We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence-including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles-indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s. JEL Codes: D80, E22, E66, G18, L50. Ã We thank},

According to Graham, the mood of Mr. Market is unstable and frequently oscillates between mania and depression. To engage a good understanding of mood disorders, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is consulted. Various versions of mood disorder are discussed. Based on observation, it is plausible that the stock market indeed suffers from bipolar disorder. The market mood model (MMM) is developed to model the dynamics of market mood. It is divided into six market phases, and each phase has its own set of market characteristics. There is a critical point for each phase and, once breached, the market moves on to the next phase. The application of the MMM utilizes three market bubbles as illustration: 1990 Japanese bubble, 2000 Internet bubble and 2007 subprime mortgage crisis.

Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows us to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity. Most generally, noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in the dark. 1986 The American Finance Association},

	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling},

However, there is empirical evidence that the prices of futures with different maturities might have, e.g., different jump behaviours in different market situations. Observing commodity futures over time, there is also evidence for different states of the underlying volatility of the futures. In this paper, we therefore allow for cointegration of the term structure within a multi-factor model, which includes seasonality, as well as joint and individual jumps in the price processes of futures with different maturities. The seasonality in this model is realized via a deterministic function, and the jumps are represented with thinned-out compound Poisson processes. The model also includes a regime-switching approach that is modelled through a Markov chain and extends the class of geometric models. We show how the model can be calibrated to empirical data and give some practical applications.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a tremendous growth in readily available news related to traded assets in international financial markets. This financial news is now available through real-time online sources such as Internet news and social media sources. The increase in the availability of financial news and investor’s ease of access to it has a potentially significant impact on market stock price movement as these news items are swiftly transformed into investors sentiment which in turn drives prices. In this study, we use the Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index constituents. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the influence of financial news sentiment scores on the stock returns of these constituents using a multi-factor model. We augment the Fama–French three-factor model with the day’s sentiment score along with lagged scores to evaluate the additional effects of financial news sentiment on stock prices in the context of this model using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Quantile Regression (QR) to analyse the effect around the tail of the return distribution. We also conduct the analysis using the seven-day simple moving average (SMA) of the scores to account for news released on non-trading days. Our results suggest that even when market factors are taken into account, sentiment scores have a significant effect on Dow Jones constituent returns and that lagged daily sentiment scores are often significant, suggesting that information compounded in these scores is not immediately reflected in security prices and related return series. The results also indicate that the SMA measure does not have a significant effect on the returns. The analysis using Quantile Regression provides evidence that the news has more impact on left tail compared to the right tail of the returns.},

However, it remains controversial whether energy and non-energy inputs are complements or substitutes. Empirical analysis is conflicting on this issue. This study seeks to explore an alternative way to explain these conflicting results by examining the issue from the perspective of energy efficiency. This study is based on time series data for capital, labor, and energy from 28 Chinese provinces, covering 1985 to 2012. The results show that capital and energy are substitutes in all of the provinces, whereas labor and energy are complements in most of the provinces. Using the threshold effect model, we discover evidence of a threshold point based on the amount of energy efficiency activity in a province. This point separates the substitution behavior of provinces between energy and non-energy inputs. Low-energy efficiency provinces do not substitute as readily as high-energy efficiency provinces. The findings imply that the energy-saving technologies should be applied in provinces with comparatively higher energy intensity because they have more energy conservation potential.},

Besides, we consider the upper quantile and lower quantile of stock return as the tourism peak season and off-season respectively. Overall, the empirical results indicate GPR exerts a lasting negative effect on tourism stock return and that the negative effect of GPR at low quantile is more significant than that at high quantile. Besides, the Chinese categorical EPU influences both negatively and positively the stock returns at different distribution levels. And during tourist off-season, the asymmetric phenomena between GPR, EPU and stock return are more obvious at lower quantiles and upper quantiles.},

The contribution of particular policy areas fluctuates greatly over time. Trade Policy news, for example, went from a virtual nonfactor in equity market volatility to a leading source after Donald Trump's election and especially after the intensification of U.S-China trade tensions. The share of EMV articles with attention to government policy rises over time, reaching its peak in 2017-18. We validate our measurement approach in various ways.

Hence, we combine a multivariate ARMA-GARCH model and wavelet multiresolution analysis to study this phenomenon. A bivariate ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1)-cDCC-Student-t model was joined with MODWT filter to capture a broad range of possible spillover effects in mean and variances of level prices at various time horizons. Generally, empirical results provide strong evidence of time-varying volatility in all markets under study. However, our proposed approach shows that oil price and stock market prices are directly affected by their own news and volatilities and indirectly affected by the volatilities of other prices and wavelet scale. The results show also, that mean and volatility spillover effects was decomposed into many sub-spillovers on different time scales according to heterogeneous investors and market participants. The practical implications of this study are critical, innovative and useful for the local and international investors and also for the portfolio managers.

	abstract = {This article studies the interrelation between spot and futures prices in the two major rice markets in prewar Japan from the perspective of market efficiency. Applying a non-Bayesian time-varying model approach to the fundamental equation for spot returns and the futures premium, we detect when efficiency reductions in the two major rice markets occurred. We also examine how government interventions affected the rice markets in Japan, which colonized Taiwan and Korea before the Second World War, and argue that the function of rice futures markets crucially depended on the differences in the structure of rice spot markets. Initially the increased volume of imported rice of a different variety from domestic rice disrupted the rice futures markets. Then, government intervention in the rice futures markets failed to improve the disruption. Changes in colonial rice cropping successfully mitigated the disruption, and colonial rice was promoted in order to unify the different varieties of inland and colonial rice.},

With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t {\textgreater} 3 will produce a large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and limitations of a p-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance of risk-taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance our field.

	abstract = {Many financial time series processes appear subject to periodic structural changes in their dynamics. Regression relationships are often not robust to outliers nor stable over time, whilst the existence of changes in variance over time is well documented. This paper considers a vector autoregression subject to pseudocyclical structural changes. The parameters of a vector autoregression are modelled as the outcome of an unobserved discrete Markov process with unknown transition probabilities. The unobserved regimes, one for each time point, together with the regime transition probabilities, are to be determined in addition to the vector autoregression parameters within each regime. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation procedure is developed which generates the joint posterior density of the parameters and the regimes, rather than the more common point estimates. The complete likelihood surface is generated at the same time. The procedure can readily be extended to produce joint prediction densities for the variables, incorporating parameter uncertainty. Results using simulated and real data are provided. A clear separation of the variance between regimes is observed. Ignoring regime shifts is very likely to produce misleading volatility estimates, and is unlikely to be robust to outliers. A comparison with commonly used models suggests that the regime switching vector autoregression provides a particularly good description of the data.},

In recent years it emerged as an important alternative measure to track and analyze the volatility of future oil prices. In this paper we firstly model and analyze the dynamic relationship between OVX changes and future crude oil price returns with time-varying coefficients, modeled using the Kalman filter, in the regression models. Empirical results show a weak negative relationship between OVX changes and future crude oil price returns movement, and extremely high/low levels of OVX cannot predict future positive/negative returns well. Secondly, this paper explores whether OVX can predict future realized volatility of crude oil price returns. The empirical findings suggest that OVX serves as an unbiased but not an efficient estimate of the future realized volatility and it includes information of the future realized volatility. Finally the incorporation of information of OVX in measuring market risk is analyzed. The empirical result indicates that Kalman filter based model provides the improved performance than the linear regression model in terms of forecasting accuracy for realized volatility prediction and the reliability for VaR estimate.},

Combining the superior features of parametric and nonparametric methods, this paper undertakes a novel approach on international volatility spillovers across 22 leading stock markets of the world. The approach is to combine wavelet techniques with time-varying conditional volatility and study the comovement of risks at the country level and regional level. Evidence suggests that comovement of risks between the U.S. market and European markets is strong mostly at lower frequencies (in the long-run) only. At higher frequencies (in the short-run), the integration of stock market risks of a country is more connected to the region to which the country belongs and less with the U.S. or other global markets. Further, during the recent financial crisis, common knowledge suggests that the spillover of risks was largely a global phenomenon, but our approach provides new insights that the spillover of risks was mostly limited at lower frequencies. In fact for countries like China, India and Malaysia even at lower frequencies there is limited evidence of spillover of risks.},

	abstract = {A common hypothesis about the behavior of limited liability asset prices in perfect markets is the random walk of returns or in its continuous-time form the geometric Brownian motion hypothesis, which implies that asset prices are stationary and log-normally distributed. A number of investigators of the behavior of stock and commodity prices have questioned the accuracy of the hypothesis. In an earlier study described in the chapter, it was examined that the continuous-time consumption-portfolio problem for an individual whose income is generated by capital gains on investments in assets with prices assumed to satisfy the “geometric Brownian motion” hypothesis. Under the additional assumption of a constant relative or constant absolute risk-aversion utility function, explicit solutions for the optimal consumption and portfolio rules were derived. The changes in these optimal rules with respect to shifts in various parameters such as expected return, interest rates, and risk were examined by the technique of comparative statics. This chapter presents an extension of these results for more general utility functions, price behavior assumptions, and income generated also from noncapital gains sources. If the geometric Brownian motion hypothesis is accepted, then a general separation or mutual fund theorem can be proved such that, in this model, the classical Tobin mean-variance rules hold without the objectionable assumptions of quadratic utility or of normality of distributions for prices. Hence, when asset prices are generated by a geometric Brownian motion, the two-asset case can be worked on without loss of generality.},

The second purpose of the study is to augment the MS-GARCH type models with artificial neural networks to benefit from the universal approximation properties to achieve improved forecasting accuracy. Therefore, the proposed Markov-switching MS-ARMA-FIGARCH, APGARCH, and FIAPGARCH processes are further augmented with MLP, Recurrent NN, and Hybrid NN type neural networks. The MS-ARMA-GARCH family and MS-ARMA-GARCH-NN family are utilized for modeling the daily stock returns in an emerging market, the Istanbul Stock Index (ISE100). Forecast accuracy is evaluated in terms of MAE, MSE, and RMSE error criteria and Diebold-Mariano equal forecast accuracy tests. The results suggest that the fractionally integrated and asymmetric power counterparts of Gray's MS-GARCH model provided promising results, while the best results are obtained for their neural network based counterparts. Further, among the models analyzed, the models based on the Hybrid-MLP and Recurrent-NN, the MS-ARMA-FIAPGARCH-HybridMLP, and MS-ARMA-FIAPGARCH-RNN provided the best forecast performances over the baseline single regime GARCH models and further, over the Gray's MS-GARCH model. Therefore, the models are promising for various economic applications. © 2014 Melike Bildirici and Özgür Ersin.},

One of the attractions to the index lies in its coverage as all the countries and by extension regions and territories in the world are considered in the construction of the index. Our results show evidence of a positive relationship between commodity price returns and the global fear index, confirming that commodity returns increase as COVID-19 related fear rises. By way of extension, we further establish that commodity market offers better safe-haven properties than the stock market given the negative association between GFI and the latter. Finally, the GFI series improves the forecast accuracy of the predictive model for commodity price returns and its forecast outcome outperforms the historical average (constant returns) model both for the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Our results are robust to alternative measures of pandemics.},

	abstract = {Although some studies recently address the association between COVID-19 sentiment and returns, volatility, or stock trading volume, no one conducts an analysis to measure the impact of investor rationality or irrationality on the influence on countries and sectors' returns. This work creates a text media sentiment and combines its influence with the outbreak cases on the stock market sector returns of the US, Europe, and their main countries most affected by the pandemic. This allows us to perceive the ranking impact of rationality or irrationality on country and sector stock returns. This work applies a random-effects robust panel estimation, with an M-estimator. This paper concludes that US returns are more sensitive to sentiment, and thus more prone to irrational factors than confirmed cases compared to Europe and that country factors influence the returns differently. In Italy and Spain as the most punished countries in Europe apart from the UK, present sector indexes return more reactive to verified cases, or rationality, namely, tourism, real estate, and the automobile (this last one in Italy). The importance of this work resides in providing a new in-depth analysis of irrational behavioral metrics among countries, which allows for comparison. Moreover, it allows observing which sectors' and which countries' asset returns are most sensitive to rational or irrational expressions of events, allowing for arbitraging, financial planning for investors, decision-makers, and academia on an in and out of pandemic context.},

Furthermore, it analyses the simultaneous influence of this new sentiment measure index on both volatility and stock returns, including causality. Applying well-established statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis, ordinary least squares, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH), generalized ARCH (GARCH), and threshold GARCH models, the findings demonstrate how EURsent is closely interrelated with the most universally recognized sentiment index in academia, demonstrating strong co-movement between the US and European stock markets, mainly prior to the global subprime crisis. The study also applies vector autoregressive modelling and OOS analysis that allows one to conclude that EURsent is a strong predictor of market returns, through the discount rate and cash flow news, although the latter is the most relevant channel. This study creates a truly representative measure of global European investor sentiment that is comparable to that created by Baker and Wurgler for the United States, interlinking a holistic sentiment measure index, sustained on new single investor sentiment proxies, with conditionally market volatility and market returns, suggesting causality. EURsent could thus be a tool for investment managers, investors, and financial service providers as well as regulators to monitor the evolution of stock markets.},

The impact of investor sentiment on market and portfolio selection has aroused great interest in the literature, however the results obtained are not consensual, considering the different methodologies used to build sentiment indices, as well as the various levels of institutional development in the market. Asymmetric volatility behaviours according to good or bad news were evaluated using the TGARCH model. The results indicate that there is an asymmetric effect of good versus bad news on the volatility of IBEX 35. It was also noted that for Portugal and Spain investor sentiment presents statistical significance with a negative sign, suggesting that market volatility is more sensitive to negative shocks in the conditional variance. In Portugal, contrary to Spain, sentiment has no relevance on return. The study reveals that investor sentiment is a key factor in selecting investment in the market. The relationship that this establishes with volatility, can help to implement policies that allow to minimize future shocks' impact on return. The study reveals for the first time that investor sentiment is a key factor in selecting investment in the market for Portugal.},

The proposed criterion is developed by correcting the asymptotic bias of the posterior mean of the loglikelihood as an estimator of its expected loglikelihood. In the evaluation of hierarchical Bayesian models with random effects, regardless of our parametric focus, the proposed criterion considers the bias correction of the posterior mean of the marginal loglikelihood because it requires a consistent parameter estimator.

This risk is currently managed by volatility ''swaps'' or futures. However , this risk could be managed more efficiently using options on volatility that were proposed in the past but were never introduced mainly due to the lack of a cost efficient tradable underlying asset. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new volatility instrument, an option on a straddle, which can be used to hedge volatility risk. The design and valuation of such an instrument are the basic ingredients of a successful financial product. In order to value these options, we combine the approaches of compound options and stochastic volatility. Our numerical results show that the straddle option is a powerful instrument to hedge volatility risk. An additional benefit of such an innovation is that it will provide a direct estimate of the market price for volatility risk.},

For the investment algorithm, we propose the use of two and three-regime, Gaussian and t-Student, MS and MS-GARCH models. This is done to forecast the probability of high volatility episodes in the SP500 and to determine the investment level in each asset. To test the algorithm, we simulated 8 portfolios that invested in these three assets, in a weekly basis from 23 December 2005 to 14 August 2020. Our results suggest that the use of MS and MS-GARCH models and VIX futures leads the simulated portfolio to outperform a buy and hold strategy in the SP500. Also, we found that this result holds only in high and extreme volatility periods. As a recommendation for practitioners, we found that our investment algorithm must be used only by institutional investors, given the impact of stock trading fees.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we employ the fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) method, which draws on a participatory approach. Specifically, the complexity of the investigated system was determined from the causal relations identified by relevant stakeholders and experts. The results show that the most effective policy strategies to improve the LoF MWMS, as identified by informants, include: fostering social innovation (e.g. communication and information campaigns); promoting technological innovation (e.g. material and process design); and supporting scientific and technological cooperation among actors. The overall diversity of the identified policy strategies suggests that policy makers must move beyond a simple “best option” approach, given the systemic complexity of the waste management sector.},

	title = {Logistic {Regression} 12.1 {Modeling} {Conditional} {Probabilities}},
	abstract = {So far, we either looked at estimating the conditional expectations of continuous variables (as in regression), or at estimating distributions. There are many situations where however we are interested in input-output relationships, as in regression, but the output variable is discrete rather than continuous. In particular there are many situations where we have binary outcomes (it snows in Pittsburgh on a given day, or it doesn't; this squirrel carries plague, or it doesn't; this loan will be paid back, or it won't; this person will get heart disease in the next five years, or they won't). In addition to the binary outcome, we have some input variables, which may or may not be continuous. How could we model and analyze such data? We could try to come up with a rule which guesses the binary output from the input variables. This is called classification, and is an important topic in statistics and machine learning. However, simply guessing "yes" or "no" is pretty crude-especially if there is no perfect rule. (Why should there be?) Something which takes noise into account, and doesn't just give a binary answer, will often be useful. In short, we want probabilities-which means we need to fit a stochastic model. What would be nice, in fact, would be to have conditional distribution of the response Y , given the input variables, Pr (Y {\textbar}X). This would tell us about how precise our predictions are. If our model says that there's a 51\% chance of snow and it doesn't snow, that's better than if it had said there was a 99\% chance of snow (though even a 99\% chance is not a sure thing). We have seen how to estimate conditional probabilities non-parametrically, and could do this using the kernels for discrete variables from lecture 6. While there are a lot of merits to this approach, it does involve coming up with a model for the joint distribution of outputs Y and inputs X , which can be quite time-consuming. Let's pick one of the classes and call it "1" and the other "0". (It doesn't matter which is which. Then Y becomes an indicator variable, and you can convince yourself that Pr (Y = 1) = E [Y ]. Similarly, Pr (Y = 1{\textbar}X = x) = E [Y {\textbar}X = x]. (In a phrase, "conditional probability is the conditional expectation of the indicator".) 223},

Using a sample of S\&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy underperforms zero. Second , the documented underperformance is less for options away from the money. Third, the underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility. Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects delta-hedged gains, even after accounting for jump fears. Our evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk premium. The notion that volatility of equity returns is stochastic has a firm footing in financial economics. However, a less than understood phenomenon is whether volatility risk is compensated, and whether this compensation is higher or lower than the risk-free rate. Is the risk from changes in market volatility positively correlated with the economy-wide pricing kernel pro-cess? If so, how does it affect the equity and option markets? Evidence that market volatility risk premium may be nonzero can be motivated by three empirical findings: Purchased options are hedges against significant market declines. This is because increased realized volatility coincides with downward market moves [French, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987) and Glosten, Jagannathan, We thank Doron Avramov,},

I develop a Markov-ARCH model that incorporates the features of both Hamilton's switching-regime model and Engle's autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model to examine the issue of volatility persistence in the monthly excess returns of the three-month treasury bill. The issue can be resolved by taking into account occasional shifts in the asymp- totic variance of the Markov-ARCH process that cause the spurious persistence of the volatility process. I identify two periods during which there is a regime shift, the 1974:2-1974:8 period as- sociated with the oil shock and the 1979:9-1982:8 period associated with the Federal Reserve's policy change. The variance approached asymptotically in these two episodes is more than 10 times as high as the asymptotic variance for the remainder of the sample. I conclude that regime shifts have a greater impact on the properties of the data, and I cannot reject the null hypothesis of no ARCH effects within the regimes. As a consequence of the striking findings in this article, previous empirical results that adopt an ARCH approach in modeling monthly or lower frequency interest-rate dynamics are rendered questionable},

The most common instruments for investing in pure volatility are variance swaps, which now enjoy an active over-the-counter (OTC) market. This paper investigates the risk-return tradeoff of variance swaps on the Deutscher Aktienin-dex and Euro STOXX 50 index over the time period from 1995 to 2004. We synthetically derive variance swap rates from the smile in option prices. Using quotes from two large investment banks over two months, we validate that the synthetic values are close to OTC market prices. We find that variance swap returns exhibit an option-like profile compared to returns of the underlying index. Given this pattern, it is crucial to account for the non-normality of returns in measuring the performance of variance swap investments. As in the US, the average returns of selling variance swaps are found to be strongly positive and too large to be compatible with standard equilibrium models. The magnitude of the estimated risk premium is related to variance uncertainty and past index returns. This indicates that the variance swap rate does not seem to incorporate all past information relevant for forecasting future realized variance.},

Nevertheless, GARCH-type models remain ubiquitous in order to allow for nonlinearities associated with time-varying volatility. Existing methods of combining the two approaches are unsatisfactory, as they either suffer from severe estimation difficulties or else their dynamic properties are not well understood. In this article we present a new Markov-switching GARCH model that overcomes both of these problems. Dynamic properties are derived and their implications for the volatility process discussed. We argue that the disaggregation of the variance process offered by the new model is more plausible than in the existing variants. The approach is illustrated with several exchange rate return series. The results suggest that a promising volatility model is an independent switching GARCH process with a possibly skewed conditional mixture density.},

However, few is known about whether this relationship is maintained over time, especially in developing economies. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate if there is a relationship between CSR activities and the financial performance of organizations, and if this relationship is maintained over time. In order to accomplish this goal, different statistical models were employed to add robustness to the results Some of the statistical models employed were univariate tests and panel data models. Our results indicate that there is a positive relationship between CSR activities and the financial performance of the company. Due to the time restriction, it is not possible to suggest that this relationship is maintained in the long term, but only in the short and medium terms. These results could provide strong evidence that could foster managers of Mexican companies to initiate or increase CSR activities},

Using a large cross-section of firms, we find that firms with better CSR performance face significantly lower capital constraints. We provide evidence that both better stakeholder engagement and transparency around CSR performance are important in reducing capital constraints. The results are further confirmed using several alternative measures of capital constraints, a paired analysis based on a ratings shock to CSR performance, an instrumental variables approach, and a simultaneous equations approach. Finally, we show that the relation is driven by both the social and environmental dimension of CSR.},

	abstract = {In organizational communication, sustainability reporting has taken on momentum. However, reporting on sustainability does not ensure the factual application of sustainable practices. It is possible that companies with risky practices increase their sustainability reporting as a window dressing measure, but also that sustainability reporting improves transparency and thus, decreases company risk. Our research is motivated by the conundrum that the reciprocal effects between risk and reporting are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study explored the bidirectional relationship between sustainability disclosure and risk. The study investigated 59 listed companies from South Africa between 2012 and 2016. Environmental, social, and governmental scores were used to assess the effect of sustainability disclosure on total, systematic, and idiosyncratic risk. Fixed effects panel regressions, statistical modelling, and Granger causality tests were employed for the investigation. Analysis revealed that sustainability disclosure in general—and disclosure on social sustainability issues in particular—reduce systematic risk in subsequent periods. Additionally, other uni- and bidirectional effects were uncovered, suggesting that higher total risk, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk nudge companies to report more on social issues in subsequent periods. At the same time, tentative evidence could be found that higher systematic risk leads to less disclosure on governance issues. Overall, disaggregating sustainability disclosure into environmental, social, and governance issues helps getting a fine-grained understanding of its bidirectional relationships with total risk, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Managers benefit from these insights by better understanding how sustainable practices and disclosing information on them can improve the market's assessment of a company's systematic risk. Investors and regulators can learn from this study which reporting strategies managers typically choose as a response to changing risk perceptions in the market.},

We further evaluate how firm governance mediates the effect of family ownership on environmental and social improvements and how national governance systems influence the response of family holdings to ESG. Research Findings/Insights. Based on a sample of 23,902 firm‐year observations drawn from 2002 to 2012 covering 46 countries and 3,893 firms, our findings show that both closely held equity and family ownership are negatively associated with ESG performance. When we control for governance, closely held equity is no longer associated with environmental and social rankings, but family ownership retains a significant negative association. These results are strong and consistent across liberal market economies (LME), whereas coordinated market economies (CME) exhibit generally weaker results and considerable diversity. Japan stands out as different from the other countries examined in depth. Theoretical/Academic Implications. Our results are consistent with agency relationships driving decisions concerning ESG commitment in LMEs. They also emphasize the role of institutional differences given the weak and variable association between ownership and ESG in CMEs. We show that families may be able to influence decisions, possibly through participation in management, despite normally effective governance constraints. As the impact of ownership and governance varies across economies and ownership type, this implies that both agency and governance should be evaluated in the context of the economic environment. Practitioner/Policy Implications. Our results offer insights to regulators and policy makers who intend to improve ESG performance. The results suggest that encouraging diversified ownership is particularly important in LMEs, that improvements in governance may benefit social and environmental performance where equity is closely held by institutions, but that governance may be less effective in the presence of family ownership.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this process, however, the integration of investors' preferences has not been adequately developed. The challenge is to integrate the preferences of heterogeneous investors—not only conventional investors but also investors who are particularly sensitive to sustainability issues (socially responsible investors)—considering that socially responsible investors are not necessarily homogeneous. This paper attempts to address this challenge by developing a methodological approach based on an application of fuzzy multicriteria decision-making methods (MCDM) to integrate ESG investors' preferences, as jointly considered. Because investors' preferences may vary depending on which material aspects are considered within a sector, this study has been tested using clothing-sector data. Results confirm the usefulness of the methodological approach proposed for a proper generation of a ‘commercial solution' that integrates the preferences of various investors and simultaneously is consistent with individually defined preferences.},

Stimulated by concerns on the use of SR as a legitimation strategy, the paper investigates whether the decision to adopt an IR stems from the need to repair legitimacy threats. By showing that IR adopters have significantly higher Bloomberg ESG disclosure ratings relative to non-adopters, we reject the hypothesis of firms adopting IR as a response to a poor rating. Additionally, we show that other proxies of legitimacy pressures (size, leverage, profitability, industry) do not play a role in explaining IR adoption. Overall, our evidence suggests that corporate engagement in IR is not a matter of strategic legitimation.},

Despite initial signals that ISO 26000 will be built on the intellectual and practical infrastructure of ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, the Advisory Group on Social Responsibility set a different direction: a guidance standard and not a specification standard against which conformity can be assessed. This paper aims to investigate what views ISO member body delegations and invited participants in international standardisation of social responsibility had about the divergence from the meta-standard approach towards a guidance standard. To answer the research question, the discussions at the ISO International Conference on Social Responsibility, where ISO member body delegations and approximately 40 invited organisations commented on this matter, have been analysed. As a result of this understanding, not only will insight into the first steps of standardisation of social responsibility be provided, but it will also shed light on the perception of ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 that are held by standard developers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We are especially interested in how the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related performance of the corresponding countries moderates this relationship. We find only weak evidence that superior corporate social performance (CSP) results in systematically reduced credit risk. However, we do find strong support for our hypothesis that a country's ESG performance moderates the CSP-credit risk relationship. Superior CSP is regarded as risk-reducing and rewarded with better ratings and lower z-spreads only if it is recognized by the environment. In addition, we find a reduction of corporate bonds' z-spreads by approx. 9.64 basis points if the CSP of a company mirrors the ESG performance of the country it is located in.},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) is becoming very important in the last two decades as a strategy that can contribute to the company and to build a more equitable and sustainable overall future financial performance. However, in what has to do with the financial performance, so far, the results obtained by the doctrine have been mixed. This paper analyzes the impact on the financial performance of Mexican listed companies that have earned the distinction of socially responsible companies. The results obtained show that there is a positive relationship between financial performance and obtaining such distinction as shown in financial variables like ROE and ROA, earnings per share (UPA) and the price ratio between books (P/VL) value. Evidence found provides some recommendations for Mexican companies and policy-makers in this field. Introducción Tras los primeros diez años del siglo XXI parece ampliamente aceptado que la creación de valor se debe producir no sólo para el accionista, sino también para el resto de los partícipes y agentes sociales, según la función que cumpla cada uno (Bueno-Campos, 2004). Este planteamiento se conoce en la literatura como el enfoque de los stakehol-ders, superado el enfoque financiero clásico de los shareholders. Milton Friedman (1962) encarna el enfoque shareholder que se resume en dos principios: 1) el único público al que la empresa debe rendir cuentas es a sus accionistas; 2) el único ob-jetivo que debe buscar la empresa es la maximización del beneficio o valor de la empresa. Por el contrario, el enfoque stakeholder engloba a la totalidad de grupos que tienen interés en la empresa que ésta tiene que equilibrar en su propio bene-ficio (Freeman, 1994). Estos grupos estarían constituidos por los accionistas, los empleados, los proveedores tanto de capital financiero como de bienes y servicios, el estado y la sociedad en su conjunto (Alonso-Almeida, 2007). Por tanto, se puede decir que la empresa es un nexo de contratos implícitos basados en la confianza y la reputación que intenta equilibrar todos los intereses involucrados en ella, tanto externos como internos (},

By implementing a variety of portfolio screens on the industry level, our analysis provides the following insights. First, regardless of geographic region, industry or ESG criterion, active selection of high- or low-rated stocks does not provide superior risk-adjusted performance in comparison to passive stock market investments. Second, in the Asia-Pacific region and in the United States, investors concentrating on ethical utility derived from their portfolio choice can follow an ESG-based investment style and still obtain a performance similar to the broad market. However, depending on the industry focus and the ESG criterion that is used, investors in Europe tend to pay a price for socially responsible investing. Third, our results are robust along several dimensions, such as the employed portfolio cut-off rate, the time frame or the consideration of transaction costs.},

Managers, investors, and scholars increasingly rely on these ratings to make strategic decisions, invest trillions of dollars in capital, and study corporate social responsibility (CSR), guided by the implicit assumption that the ratings are valid. We document the surprising lack of agreement across social ratings from six well-established raters. These differences remain even when we adjust for explicit differences in the definition of CSR held by different raters, implying the ratings have low validity. Our results suggest that users of social ratings should exercise caution in interpreting their connection to actual CSR and that raters should conduct regular evaluations of their ratings. Managerial summary: Ratings of corporate social responsibility (CSR) guide trillions of dollars of investment, but managers, investors, and researchers know little about whether these ratings accurately measure CSR. In practice, there are examples of highly rated firms becoming embroiled in scandals and the same firm receiving sharply different ratings from different rating agencies. We evaluate six of the leading raters and find little overlap in their assessments of CSR. This lack of consensus suggests that social responsibility is challenging to measure reliably and that users of these ratings should be cautious in drawing conclusions about firms based on this data. We encourage the rating agencies to regularly validate their data in an effort to improve the measurement of CSR.},

However, the terms "sustainable development", "sustainability" and "sustainable" are sometimes over- and misused despite wide consensus about the concept's meaning among sustainability scholars and practitioners. While the concept allows various sustainability views to co-exist, random conceptualizations which do not respect the fundamental sustainability principles undermine the concept's objective to steer action. This lack of understanding of sustainability arguably inhibits its practical realization and a proper understanding of sustainability is urgently needed. In this paper we aim to contribute to a better understanding of sustainability by adopting a bird's eye perspective. We review the rich contemporary literature, with a specific focus on the terminology, genesis, fundamental principles, mainstream views of sustainability, and several governing aspects. Further, using the evolving body of sustainability literature, the paper provides arguments to combat common misconceptions of sustainability. © 2011 by the authors.},

This paper exhibits an exhaustive overview about the different criteria for evaluation used by sustainability indices and ESG agencies. The sample comprises a group of six sustainability indices and ten ESG agencies. The importance of the sustainability indices and ESG agencies is increasing in terms of encouraging the implementation of responsible corporate policies. This is considered as an important research topic because of the growth of social responsible financial markets, and the fact that investors are demanding more and more information about these topics. The results suggest that the methods currently being used by ESG agencies and sustainability indices are diverse and show a lack of standardisation.},

We observe significant unidirectional volatility transmissions from conventional to sustainable equities, suggesting that the criteria applied for socially responsible investments do not necessarily shield these securities from common market shocks. While significant dynamic correlations are observed between sustainable and conventional stocks, particularly in Europe, the analysis of both in- and out-of-sample dynamic portfolios suggests that supplementing conventional stock portfolios with sustainable counterparts improves the risk/return profile of stock portfolios in all regions. The findings overall suggest that sustainable investments can indeed provide diversification gains for conventional stock portfolios globally.},

	abstract = {The growth of socially responsible investment (SRI) on public financial markets has drawn considerable academic attention over the last decade. Discarding from the previous literature, this article sets up to analyze the Private Equity channel, which is shown to have the potentiality to foster sustainable practices in unlisted companies. The fast integration of the environmental, social and governance issues by mainstream Private Equity investors is unveiled and appears to have benefited from the maturation of SRI on public financial markets and the impetus of large conventional actors. Hypotheses on the characteristics and drivers of this movement are proposed and tested on a unique database covering the French Private Equity industry in 2011. Empirical findings support that Private Equity socially responsible investing is characterized by investor engagement and strategically driven by a need for new value creation sources, increased risk management and differentiation. In particular, results show that independent funds, which need to attract investors, are more likely than captive funds to develop socially responsible practices. Evolution of the movement and future research paths are proposed.},

	abstract = {This article presents a framework intended to provide pension funds with practical guidance for the successful implementation of a sustainable investing strategy. The framework is developed with respect to the UK and US pension funds (as these share certain common legal characteristics) and focuses on the changes that pension funds adopting such a strategy should make to their investment strategies and governance (particularly through the formulation and articulation of clear investment mission and strong investment beliefs). The article proceeds with a review of socially responsible investment (SRI) and more recent responsible investment (RI) literature, in the context of growing public awareness (but not necessarily understanding) of the concept of sustainability ('Literature review of SRI field: SRI, RI and sustainable investing' section). It then examines the literature on pension fund governance, arguing the need for more detailed practical guidance for funds moving towards sustainable investing, especially for those implementing a sustainable investing strategy ('Anglo-American pension fund governance' section). It presents the framework for the practical implementation of sustainable investing in the 'Sustainable investing framework' section. Finally, we review the relevant Anglo-American legal backdrop, outlining how pension funds adopting our framework should approach their fiduciary obligations, and then discussing potential regulatory enablers of sustainable investment ('Legal context: barriers to and enablers of sustainable investing' section).

	doi = {10.1007/s10551-004-5455-0},
	abstract = {With assets of over US\$1.0 trillion and growing, public pension funds in the United States have become a major force in the private sector through their holding of equity positions in large publicly traded corporations. More recently, these funds have been expanding their investment strategy by considering a corporation's long-term risks on issues such as environmental protection, sustainability, and good corporate citizenship, and how these factors impact a company's long-term performance. Conventional wisdom argues that the fiduciary responsibility of the pension funds' trustees must be solely focused on their beneficiaries and, therefore, their investment criteria must be based strictly on narrowly defined financial measures. It is also asserted that well-established financial measurements of corporate performance already include long-term risk assessment through discounted present value of future flow of earnings. Consequently, all other criteria are contrary to the best interest of the pension funds' beneficiaries. In this paper, we assert that, contrary to conventional wisdom, pension funds, and for that matter other mutual funds, must be concerned with the long-term survival and growth of corporations. These measures are generally referred to "socially responsible investing" (SRI) and when applied to corporations, it is termed "socially responsible corporate conduct (SRCC)." We demonstrate that current measurement of future risk assessment invariably understates, and quite often completely overlooks, these long-term risks because of the inherent bias towards short-run on the part of financial intermediaries whose compensation depends greatly on short-term results. Furthermore, there is ample evidence to suggest that these intermediaries have been engaging in self- serving practices and thus failing in their duties to serve their clients', i.e. pension funds', best interests. Because of their large holdings in the total market as well as individual companies, these funds cannot easily divest from poorly performing companies without destabilizing the companies' stock and overall markets. Hence, they must opt for a strategy of emphasizing investment criteria that encourage companies to take into account long-term aspects of their operations in terms of their impact on environment, sustainability, and community welfare, to name a few. We argue that an exclusionary, and even a primary, focus on short-term financial criteria is no longer a viable option. It also calls for the pension funds to encourage greater transparency and accountability of the entire corporate sector through improved corporate governance. Thus socially responsible investing practices are not merely discretionary and desirable activities; they are a necessary imperative, which both the corporations and public pension funds, and other large institutional holders, will ignore at serious peril to themselves. Finally, the paper considers some of the recent developments where corporations have been responding to these challenges and how their actions might be strengthened through greater disclosure and transparency of corporate activities. It also makes recommendations for the pension funds to support further research in creating new measurement standards that further refine the concept of socially responsible investing as a necessary ingredient of long-term corporate survival and growth in the context of a changing economic, environmental and sociopolitical dynamic.

Our method captures both the 'fat-tailed' nature of asset returns and their correlation with discount rate changes. We show that the standard assumption of constant discount rates leads to dramatic underestimation of future projections of pension plan solvency risk. Failing to incorporate leptokurtosis into asset returns also leads to downward biased estimates of risk, but this is less pronounced than the time-varying discount rate effect. Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns. These results have important implications for those with responsibility for balancing risk against expected return when seeking to improve the current poor funding positions of DB pension schemes.},

Data frequency is monthly periods from October 2011 to October 2020. The SVAR results show that a demand shock has a major long-run effect on Vietnamese stock markets, while a supply shock has no such impact. The NADRL's finding reveals that only positive and negative aggregate demand shock imposes strong effects on Vietnam stock indices in the long run. In terms of asymmetry features, the Wald coefficient test for NADRL shows that the supply shock and oil market-specific demand shock have asymmetric effects on the index of the Ho Chi Minh stock market in the long run. Major findings suggest that market controllers have to speed up their development of the domestic oil market. Investors have to pay attention to the demand information.},

Para ello, se ha construido una tabla de movilidad y se han calculado diversos índices para diferenciar entre países estáticos y países dinámicos en términos de competitividad turística. Seguidamente, se ha utilizado un test de cambio estructural para verificar la influencia de la competitividad sobre la variación de seis variables turísticas (PIB, empleo, consumo, exportaciones, gasto doméstico e inversiones). Los resultados demuestran empíricamente que la mejora de la capacidad competitiva tiene un efecto positivo sobre la mayoría de las variables turísticas analizadas.

	abstract = {Investor sentiment is a research area in the theoretical field of behavioural finance that analyses the sentiment of investors and the way it influences stock market activity. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of publications in this area, which indicates its incremental relevance. To date, there is no consensus on the theoretical structure of behavioural finance nor on the investor sentiment research area. We have used co-citation, bibliographic coupling and co-occurrence analysis to provide an overview of the structure of investor sentiment. Therefore, this study contributes to defining the theoretical structure of investor sentiment by identifying the foundations of the research area and main journals, references, authors, or keywords, which represent the core of knowledge of this research area. The results obtained suggest that investor sentiment is related to efficient market theory and behavioural finance theories. Furthermore, investor sentiment is a relevant research field, especially since 2014. Advances in computer science or theories based on physics or mathematics can help to better define the influence of investor sentiment on stock markets. This study advances research on investor sentiment within the field of behavioural finance, thus showing its relevance.},

The data are from a commercial-strength comprehensive textual analysis that provides 24-hr rolling average scores of total references in the news and social media by counting overall positive references net of negative references. The authors select 4 measures of investor sentiment that reflect both pessimism and optimism of small investors. These measures are fear, gloom, joy, and stress. The objective is twofold. First, the authors examine the ability of these sentiment measures to predict market returns. Second, they are interested in exploring the effects of these sentiment measures on market return and volatility. For this purpose, the authors utilize threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. They explore the ability of sentiment measures to predict both the level of and change in market returns. The sentiment measure of stress has a small effect on the market return for a 1-day lag. The other 2 sentiment measures, gloom and joy, seem to play no role in predicting market returns. Furthermore, the authors find that fear among investors has a major and lasting effect on market returns and conditional volatility.},

In this study, we examine how innovation performance affects two different facets of firm performance: market performance and financial performance. Many studies address the relationship between innovation and business performance, but few empirical studies analyze the interplay between those variables. Research results reveal a suppression effect of market performance on the innovation–financial performance relationship. We find a negative direct relationship between innovation and financial performance; however, market performance reverses this negative effect to a positive total influence through its suppression effect. This result indicates the vital role of market performance in converting innovation to positive financial outcomes. The proposed mediation model is relevant regardless of the set of firm-level and environmental contingency variables.},

Two information revolutions are underway in trading and investing. Most headlines focus on structured quantitative market information at ever higher frequencies, but the other technology revolution in trading and investing is driven by qualitative, textual, and relationship information. The IBM computer Watson’s overwhelming Jeopardy victory demonstrated how good machines can get at this. News analysis is a focus of language technology in finance. In this article, Leinweber and Sisk include event studies and show U.S. portfolio simulation results for “pure news” signals applied over the period 2006–2009 as well as a true out-of-sample period in 2010, which indicates alpha in excess of 10\% a year. The authors also describe other applications of automated qualitative analysis for information-driven social media client relations.},

	abstract = {As evidence from existing literature contradicts classical finance suggesting that there is room for investor sentiment in stock prices, and there is evidence that indicates a possible change in this relationship in the subprime mortgage crisis (since 2007), this article uses several methods to measure investor sentiment for both individual and institutional investors in the US, and then frees it from macroeconomic trends. The Granger-causality test is used to ensure that it is investor sentiment causing stock market price changes, and not vice versa. Changes in stock market prices are then regressed on changes in the investor sentiment data freed of macroeconomic trends. The resulting regression coefficients from before and during the crisis are compared to determine the impact the subprime mortgage crisis has had on the relationship between investor sentiment and stock market prices. Out of the five investor sentiment indexes used, only two exhibit significant causality in the desired direction (the Individual One-Year Confidence Index and the Individual Valuation Confidence Index, both from Yale). For the Individual One-Year Confidence Index, strong statistical evidence is found that the predictive power of investor sentiment over stock market prices has increased in the subprime mortgage crisis. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The unpredict- ability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational inves- tors do. The model sheds light on a number of financial anomalies, including the excess volatility of asset prices, the mean reversion of stock returns, the underpricing of closed-end mutual funds, and the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle.},

The sample consists of four subcategories: agricultural, livestock, energy and metal futures, for a total of 26 commodity futures spanning from the period 1968 to 2010. Overall, commodity futures perform better when investor sentiment is pessimistic rather than optimistic. The asymmetrical response to sentiment shocks may partially account for this difference. Cross-sectional analysis indicates a persistent negative relationship between investor sentiment and commodity futures returns, even after controlling for the effects of liquidity and open interest. Additional analysis shows that when conditional volatilities are high, the negative relationship between investor sentiment and commodity futures returns becomes more pronounced.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between UNGC adoption and firm performance. Starting from a literature analysis, we develop eight research hypotheses, three of them related to the effects of UNGC on performance (labor productivity, sales growth, and profitability), and five related to contextual factors that might affect them. We empirically test these hypotheses through a structured longitudinal event study analysis and an ordinary least square multiple regression, using balance sheet data of a cross-country and cross-industry sample of 810 companies gathered from the Standard and Poor Capital IQ's Compustat Global and North America datasets. The results demonstrate a significant positive impact of UNGC adoption on sales growth and profitability, whereas no significant impact emerged on labor productivity. In terms of affecting factors, country development and cultural features affect the impact on sales performance, whereas UN vendorship affects the impact on profitability. The study contributes to the scientific debate by developing and empirically testing a comprehensive theory-grounded framework on the impact of UNGC on firm performance. It also provides significant insights of relevance for managers, firms, regulatory bodies and policy makers.},

We derive that the segment of values-driven investors primarily uses ‘‘negative’’ screens to avoid controversial stocks, while the profit-driven segment uses ‘‘positive’’ screens. As the result of an empirical analysis over the period 1992–2008, we base our segmentation on investment screens that help us to examine whether values affect prices. We find that, although the profit-driven segment earns abnormal returns in the short run, these profit-generating opportunities do not persist in the long run for SRI stocks. However, our conclusions highlight the observation that different views on SRI can be com- plementary in the short run},

Indeed, by improving forecast accuracy and precision, this exercise would certainly help firms to anticipate economic fluctuations, thus leading to more profitable business and investment strategies. Yet, how to extract the behavioural component from real market data remains an open question. By using monthly data on the returns of the constituents of the S\&P 500 index, we propose a Bayesian methodology to measure the extent to which market data conform to what is predicted by prospect theory (the behavioural perspective), relative to the (standard) subjective expected utility theory baseline. We document a significant behavioural component that reaches its peaks during recession periods and is correlated to measures of financial volatility, market sentiment and financial stress with expected sign. Moreover, the behavioural component decreases around macroeconomic corporate earnings news, while it reacts positively to the number of surprising announcements.},

	doi = {10.1111/iere.12132},
	abstract = {Recent work on econometric detection mechanisms has shown the effectiveness of recursive procedures in identifying and dating financial bubbles in real time. These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real‐time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple‐bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. (“Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values?” International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201–26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real‐time date‐stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S\&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well‐known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

These measures include the volatility index, the put-call ratio, and the trading index. The empirical results show that these variables over a variety of specifications frequently have statistically and economically significant forecasting power. The results indicate that these variables are contrarian indicators, consistent with the view that periods of extreme fear in the stock market have provided excellent buying opportunities. Finally, out-of-sample trading simulations performed over the second half of the sample period demonstrate that profits and risk-adjusted profits would have been enhanced by buying S\&P futures when the fear indicators were high rather than low. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Volatility products have become popular in the past 15 years as a hedge against market uncertainty. In particular, there is growing interest in options on the VIX volatility index. A number of recent empirical studies have examine whether there is significantly greater risk premium in VIX option prices compared with S\&P 500 option prices. We address this issue by proposing and analysing a stochastic volatility model with regime switching. The basic Heston model cannot capture VIX-implied volatilities, as has been documented. We show that the incorporation of sharp regime shifts can bridge this shortcoming. We take advantage of asymptotic and Fourier methods to make the extension tractable, and we present a fit to data, both in times of crisis and relative calm, which shows the effectiveness of the regime switching.},

For this purpose, we conducted a standard event study analysis in order to assess the financial response to such hydrological risk on a sample of seven Brazilian agri-food firms. We found statistically significant negative cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) around the drought official announcement for different event windows used. Particularly, the highest impact was obtained for the narrowest temporary window, five days around the event disclosure. Moreover, we also found the drought announcement affects even more negatively those companies that sell perishable products, five out of seven in our sample, versus those selling nonperishable ones by running a two-sample t-test on CAARs. This study brings awareness to the climate change impact into the emerging financial markets and the risk faced by shareholders when investing in the agri-food sector, not only in Brazil but also in other Latin American countries, due to the increasing probability to suffer from droughts.},

We use a sample of 80 open-end investment funds and pension funds with daily returns between 2016 and 2018. Our methodology consists of measuring changes in the daily conditional volatility for the fund returns (EGARCH) and changes in their conditional correlation with selected market risk factors (DCC MV-GARCH) throughout different volatility regimes identified using a Markov Regime Switching model. We argue that, on average, the level of conditional correlations between funds and market risk factors remained stable and unconcerned by the volatility regimes. In addition, for only less than half of the funds in the sample, their volatility regimes were synchronized with those of the selected market risk factors. We found that, on average, fund returns are more correlated with equity returns and less correlated with changes in local bond yields, while not being significantly influenced by changes in foreign bond yields or changes in foreign exchange. During the period investigated equity returns were the most volatile while the funds returns volatility were, on average, much more reduced. Overall, our results show the resilience of the Romanian collective investment sector to the selected market risk factors, during the investigated period.},

For this purpose, we employ a combination of novel statistical techniques, including Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Markov-switching GJR-GARCH, and vine copula methods. Using a data set consisting of daily stock and world crude oil prices, we find evidence of a structure break in the volatility process, consisting of high and low persistence volatility processes, with a high persistence in the probabilities of transition between lower and higher volatility regimes, as well as the presence of leverage effects. Furthermore, our results based on the C-vine copula confirm the existence of two types of tail dependence: symmetric tail dependence between South Africa and China, South Africa and Russia, and South Africa and India, and asymmetric lower tail dependence between South Africa and Brazil, and South Africa and crude oil. For the purpose of diversification in these markets, we formulate an asset allocation problem using raw returns, MS GARCH returns, and C-vine and R-vine copula-based returns, and optimize it using a Particle Swarm optimization algorithm with a rebalancing strategy. The results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the risk contribution and asset allocation of South Africa and the crude oil market, supporting the existence of a lower tail dependence between them. This suggests that, when South African stocks are in distress, investors tend to shift their holdings in the oil market. Similar results are found between Russia and crude oil, as well as Brazil and crude oil. In the symmetric tail, South African asset allocation is found to have a well-diversified relationship with that of China, Russia, and India, suggesting that these three markets might be good investment destinations when things are not good in South Africa, and vice versa.},

Investing in a volatile market is riskier for stock traders. Most of the existing work considered Generalized Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to capture volatility, but this model fails to capture when the volatility is very high. This paper aims to estimate the stock price volatility using the Markov regime-switching GARCH (MSGARCH) and SETAR model. The model selection was carried out using the Akaike-Informations-Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian-Information Criteria (BIC) metric. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) metric. We have found that volatility estimation using the MSGARCH model performed better than the SETAR model. The experiments considered the Indian stock market data.},

	title = {Stochastic model specification in {Markov} switching vector error correction models},
	volume = {25},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a hierarchical modeling approach to perform stochastic model specification in Markov switching vector error correction models. We assume that a common distribution gives rise to the regime-specific regression coefficients. The mean as well as the variances of this distribution are treated as fully stochastic and suitable shrinkage priors are used. These shrinkage priors enable to assess which coefficients differ across regimes in a flexible manner. In the case of similar coefficients, our model pushes the respective regions of the parameter space towards the common distribution. This allows for selecting a parsimonious model while still maintaining sufficient flexibility to control for sudden shifts in the parameters, if necessary. We apply our modeling approach to real-time Euro area data and assume transition probabilities between expansionary and recessionary regimes to be driven by the cointegration errors. The results suggest that the regime allocation is governed by a subset of short-run adjustment coefficients and regime-specific variance-covariance matrices. These findings are complemented by an out-of-sample forecast exercise, illustrating the advantages of the model for predicting Euro area inflation in real time. JEL: C11, C32, E31, E32, E44},

	abstract = {The synthesis of the dynamic factor model of Stock and Watson (1989) and the regime-switching model of Hamilton (1989) proposed by Diebold and Rudebusch (1996) potentially encompasses both features of the business cycle identified by Burns and Mitchell (1946): (1) comove-ment among economic variables through the cycle and (2) nonlinearity in its evolution. However, maximum-likelihood estimation has required approximation. Recent advances in multimove Gibbs sampling methodology open the way to approximation-free inference in such non-Gaussian, nonlinear models. This paper estimates the model for U.S. data and attempts to address three questions: Are both features of the business cycle empirically relevant? Might the implied new index of coincident indicators be a useful one in practice? Do the resulting estimates of regime switches show evidence of duration dependence? The answers to all three would appear to be yes.},

We first adjust the moment function so that the gradient of the future loss function is insensitive (formally, Neyman-orthogonal) with respect to the first-stage regularization bias, preserving the single index property. We then take the loss function to be an indefinite integral of the adjusted moment function with respect to the single index. The proposed Lasso estimator converges at the oracle rate, where the oracle knows the nuisance function and solves only the parametric problem. We demonstrate our method by estimating the short-term heterogeneous impact of Connecticut’s Jobs First welfare reform experiment on women’s welfare participation decision.},

Behav-ioral finance-that is, finance from a broader social science perspective including psychology and sociology-is now one of the most vital research programs , and it stands in sharp contradiction to much of efficient markets theory. The efficient markets theory reached its height of dominance in academic circles around the 1970s. At that time, the rational expectations revolution in economic theory was in its first blush of enthusiasm, a fresh new idea that occupied the center of attention. The idea that speculative asset prices such as stock prices always incorporate the best information about fundamental values and that prices change only because of good, sensible information meshed very well with theoretical trends of the time. Prominent finance models of the 1970s related speculative asset prices to economic fundamentals, using rational expectations to tie together finance and the entire economy in one elegant theory. For example, Robert Merton published "An Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model" in 1973, which showed how to generalize the capital asset pricing model to a comprehensive intertemporal general equilibrium model. Robert Lucas published "Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy" in 1978, which showed that in a rational expectations general equilibrium, rational asset prices may have a forecastable element that is related to the forecastability of consumption. Douglas Breeden published his theory of "consumption betas" in 1979, where a stock's beta (which measures the sensitivity of its return compared to some index) was determined by the correlation},

Current practice for estimating the expected market return adds the historical average realized excess market returns to the current observed interest rate. While this model explicitly reflects the dependence of the market return on the interest rate, it fails to account for the effect of changes in the level of market risk. Three models of equilibrium expected market returns which reflect this dependence are analyzed in this paper. Estimation procedures which incorporate the prior restriction that equilibrium expected excess returns on the market must be positive are derived and applied to return data for the period 1926–1978. The principal conclusions from this exploratory investigation are: (1) in estimating models of the expected market return, the non-negativity restriction of the expected excess return should be explicity included as part of the specification: (2) estimators which use realized returns should be adjusted for heteroscedasticity. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

The analysis constructs a new index that describes the tone of the sentiment derived from these announcements, spanning the period January 2002 to June 2016. The novelty of this work relies on the development of a unique sentiment index associated with the messages conveyed by the ECB’s activities and the effect of this index on both the mean and the volatility of certain major international stock markets. In this context, the sentiment index is present in both the conditional mean and the volatility equations. The findings indicate a significant impact on both the mean and the volatility of returns, whereas the news sentiment/stock returns association increases in strength during the crisis period. The findings survive a robustness check based on the characteristics of the ECB governor’s personality.},

Empirical evidence from a sentiment-augmented TGARCH model demonstrates that there is an asymmetric property for all markets. The estimated coefficient of country-specific consumer confidence index used as a proxy for investor sentiment is statistically significant and negative for France and Germany, but statistically significant and positive for Ireland alone. The results provide evidence that in France and Germany, stock market volatility is sensitive to negative shock in investor sentiment, supporting the existence of the leverage effect; in Ireland, however, no such sensitivity exists. The results of this study should be of a particular interest for both domestic and international investors, academic researchers and policymakers in terms of international portfolio diversification. Investors can potentially improve their portfolio performance by considering investor sentiment, while policymakers can take steps to stabilize investor sentiment, thereby reducing stock market volatility and uncertainty.},

The paper examines the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the different phases of lockdown. In addition, the effect of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 spread was compared. A comparative analysis of the stock market performances and sustainability of selected South Asian countries is also included in the study, which covers the lockdown period as well as the time frame of the first and second waves of COVID-19 spread. To examine the above relationship, the conventional Welch test, heteroskedastic independent t-test, and the GMM multivariate analysis is employed, on the stock return, gold prices, and oil prices. The findings conclude that during the different phases of lockdown in India, COVID-19 has a negative and significant impact on oil prices and stock market performance. However, in terms of gold prices, the effect is positive and significant. The results of the first wave of COVID-19 infection also corroborate with the above findings. However, the results are contradictory during the second wave of coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study also substantiates that COVID-19 has significantly affected the stock market performances of selected South Asian countries. However, the impact on the stock market performances was only for a short period and it diminished in the second wave of COVID-19 spread in all the selected South Asian countries. The findings contribute to the research on the stock and commodity market impact of a pandemic by providing empirical evidence that COVID-19 has spill-over effects on stock markets and commodity market performances. This result also helps investors in assessing the trends of the stock and commodity markets during the pandemic outbreak.},

Then, we analyze medium-term changes in stock returns and their systematic risk by an econometric estimation of the capital asset pricing model. Our event-study analysis of the forest products industry shows that the forestry subsector was impacted more than the paper subsector when the WHO declared the pandemic. The effect was most prominent in North America. We find that the systematic risk for the forestry subsector tended to increase during 2020, until October. Again, this effect was most clear in North America. Conversely, the impact on the paper subsector was more stable.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of COVID-19 on the volatility of Australian stock returns and the effect of negative and positive news (shocks) by investigating the asymmetric nature of the shocks and leverage impact on volatility. We employ a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and extend the analysis using the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model to capture asymmetry and allegedly leverage. We proxy the news related to the negative effect of COVID-19 on the Australian health system and its economy as bad news, and on the other hand, measures taken by government economic stimulus packages through their monetary and fiscal policies as good news. The S\&amp;P ASX200 (ASX-200) index is used as a proxy to the Australian stock market, and we use value-weighted returns of the stocks listed on ASX-200 for the period 27 January 2020 to 29 December 2020. The empirical results suggest the EGARCH model fits better in capturing asymmetry and leverage than the GARCH model in estimating the volatility of the Australian stock returns. However, another interesting finding is that the EGARCH model with volatility equation without news demonstrates a larger (smaller) leverage effect of the negative (positive) shocks on the conditional volatility compared to its variant with the news.},

	abstract = {We analyze the price return distributions of currency exchange rates, cryptocurrencies, and contracts for differences (CFDs) representing stock indices, stock shares, and commodities. Based on recent data from the years 2017–2020, we model tails of the return distributions at different time scales by using power-law, stretched exponential, and q-Gaussian functions. We focus on the fitted function parameters and how they change over the years by comparing our results with those from earlier studies and find that, on the time horizons of up to a few minutes, the so-called “inverse-cubic power-law” still constitutes an appropriate global reference. However, we no longer observe the hypothesized universal constant acceleration of the market time flow that was manifested before in an ever faster convergence of empirical return distributions towards the normal distribution. Our results do not exclude such a scenario but, rather, suggest that some other short-term processes related to a current market situation alter market dynamics and may mask this scenario. Real market dynamics is associated with a continuous alternation of different regimes with different statistical properties. An example is the COVID-19 pandemic outburst, which had an enormous yet short-time impact on financial markets. We also point out that two factors—speed of the market time flow and the asset cross-correlation magnitude—while related (the larger the speed, the larger the cross-correlations on a given time scale), act in opposite directions with regard to the return distribution tails, which can affect the expected distribution convergence to the normal distribution.},

The quantitative investigation was performed using GARCH approach. In the survey, the GARCH model (1,1) was applied to explore the volatility of the BET and BSE traded shares. Conditional volatility for the daily return series showed noticeable evidence of volatility that shifts over the explored period. In the first quarter of 2020, the Romanian equity market volatility increased to a level very close to that recorded during the global financial crisis of 2007–2009.

Multi-state models for such data are generally based on the Markov assumption. This article reviews the range of Markov models and their extensions which can be fitted to panel-observed data, and their implementation in the  msm  package for R. Transition intensities may vary between individuals, or with piecewise-constant time-dependent covariates, giving an inhomogeneous Markov model. Hidden Markov models can be used for multi-state processes which are misclassified or observed only through a noisy marker. The package is intended to be straightforward to use, flexible and comprehensively documented. Worked examples are given of the use of  msm  to model chronic disease progression and screening. Assessment of model fit, and potential future developments of the software, are also discussed.},

It has been found that large speculator sentiment forecasts price continuations. In contrast, large hedger sentiment predicts price reversals. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future market movements. An investigation was performed into various sentiment-based timing strategies, and it was found that the combination of extreme large trader sentiments provides the strongest timing signal. These results are generally consistent with the hedging-pressure theory, suggesting that hedgers pay risk premiums to transfer nonmarketable risks in futures markets. Moreover, it does not appear that large speculators in the futures markets possess any superior forecasting ability. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

We remove the potentially confounding influences of differences in manager skill, transaction costs and fees, and conduct a clean experiment on the effect of positive and negative portfolio screening.

The period analyzed commences from January 1994 and concludes in January 2013 and yields 18 US and 89 European green funds. The results obtained for green fund managers are compared with those achieved for conventional and other forms of SR mutual fund managers. We control for the mutual fund investment objective (distinguishing between domestic and global portfolios) and for the effect of crisis market periods. For US SR funds, partitioning the data into crisis and normal periods reveals that SR funds obtain statistically insignificant performance in crisis periods but underperform relative to the market in normal periods. Furthermore, the findings indicate that green funds do not perform worse than other forms of SR mutual funds. For European SR funds partitioning the data into crisis and normal periods reveals that SR funds obtain statistically insignificant performance irrespective of market conditions. Similar to the US findings, green Europe SR funds do not perform worse than other forms of SR mutual funds. Managerial abilities are not evident in the findings though unsuccessful timing of the market is revealed for both Europe and US global green funds. When analyzing managerial abilities in crisis and non-crisis market periods, US green fund managers achieve better results in crisis market periods and the opposite occurs for green fund managers in European market.

Non-financial data reporting contributes to increased transparency, predictability of companies' operations and hence to significant reduction in information asymmetry on the capital market, and ultimately considerably reduces forecasting errors in risk–return profile of investment portfolios. The research conducted has shown that there is a large information gap on the Polish market, especially as regards ESG reporting. The overall level of reporting on non-financial data is low. In the analysed period, the shares issued by companies with higher ESG rating were distinguished by an over-average return rate and lower return rate volatility as well as lower forecasting error in return rates, which is indicated by the standard error parameter (alpha and beta coefficients).{\textbackslash}n},

By implementing a variety of portfolio screens on the industry level, our analysis provides the following insights. First, regardless of geographic region, industry or ESG criterion, active selection of high- or low-rated stocks does not provide superior risk-adjusted performance in comparison to passive stock market investments. Second, in the Asia-Pacific region and in the United States, investors concentrating on ethical utility derived from their portfolio choice can follow an ESG-based investment style and still obtain a performance similar to the broad market. However, depending on the industry focus and the ESG criterion that is used, investors in Europe tend to pay a price for socially responsible investing. Third, our results are robust along several dimensions, such as the employed portfolio cut-off rate, the time frame or the consideration of transaction costs.},

TheVice Fund,which invests in unethical firms, outperforms in low-volatility regimes, but underperforms in high-volatility regimes. These results contradict the Vice Fund’s claim that it constitutes a “solid investment during recessionary periods”.

Seven peer-reviewed papers were selected that aimed to define and explain sustainable business models and that have been widely cited. The papers were analyzed by assessing the elements and activities covered using the corporate sustainability framework, and by comparing them against four approaches to explain organizations. The paper proposes a definition and framework for more sustainable business models aimed at integrating organizational approaches, the company system, stakeholders, change and sustainability dimensions, thus providing a more holistic and systemic approach to discourses on sustainable business models.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, there has been increasing research on Corporate Sustainability, whereby most of such research was undertaken in theWestern world. This paper is aimed at analysing the contribution of Japanese Business terms to Corporate Sustainability. The paper analyses, using Grounded Theory, 28 Japanese business terms through a Corporate Sustainability framework based on the four dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, social, and time), the company system (operations and processes, strategy and management, organisational systems, procurement and marketing, and assessment and communication), and stakeholders (internal, interconnecting, and external). The underpinning principles of the Japanese business terms provide complementary approaches toWestern views on corporate sustainability by offering a more holistic perspective by linking the company system and its stakeholders to the four dimensions of sustainability. The paper proposes that Corporate Sustainability can learn from Japanese business approaches through: (1) the interaction and alignment of the factory, the firm, and inter-firm network; (2) the relationships between management and employees; (3) the inter-linkages between the company system elements; and (4) how Japanese companies remained competitive, even under the stress of a long-term major economic crisis. However, the analysis indicates that the relationship with external stakeholders and communicating with them through assessment and reporting is lacking in Japanese business management practice. Japanese businesses and their management can also learn from the Corporate Sustainability of the West by: (1) considering the four dimensions of sustainability and how they interact; (2) taking a holistic and systemic approach to Corporate Sustainability; (3) engaging in more Corporate Sustainability research; and (4) making Corporate Sustainability part of a company's culture and activities. Businesses in the East and theWest need to recognise that they can both contribute to making the world more sustainable by learning from each other's approaches on Corporate Sustainability and adapting them to their own contexts.},

The paper provides an analysis of sixteen of the most widely used initiatives (e.g. life cycle assessment, eco-design, cleaner production, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability reporting). Each initiative was analysed on how it contributes or addresses the four dimensions of sustainability, and the company system. It was found that each initiative has advantages with respect to scope and focus for the sustainability dimensions and the company system's elements, but it has certain disadvantages when it comes to dealing with the complexity and broadness of sustainability. The paper discusses how relying on one initiative can result in a limited and narrow contribution to sustainability and curtail coverage of the company's system. The results indicate that the least addressed elements of the company system have been organisational systems and procurement and marketing. A new framework, the Corporate Integration of Voluntary Initiatives for Sustainability (CIVIS), is proposed with two purposes: (1) to help company leaders better understand how to improve their company's contribution to sustainability, and (2) to foster a holistic approach through the combination of company initiatives that would help to embed sustainability into a company's system with the least effort and maximum results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a three-step framework by incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance into portfolio optimization. In comparison to studies using weighted ESG rating scores, we constructed a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model with quadratic and cubic terms to enhance the evidence of two or more aspects, as well as the interaction between the environmental, social, and governance attributes. We then combined the ESG scores with financial indicators to select assets based on a cross-efficiency analysis. The portfolio optimization model incorporating ESG scores with selected assets was constructed to obtain a social responsibility investment strategy. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it in the United States industrial stock market from 2005 to 2017. The empirical results show that the obtained SRI portfolio may be superior to traditional investment strategies in many aspects and may simultaneously achieve the consistency of investment and social values.},

This study aims to disentangle the existing evidence by exploring the moderating role of family firm status. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes the moderating role of family firm status on the relation between gender diversity and firm performance among a sample of 88 Italian wine firms from Campania region during the 2007-2014 period. This work uses random effects panel data regression and tests the robustness of the results using alternative econometric techniques. Performance is measured in terms of profitability. Findings The findings reveal that women in top positions do not affect firm performance. However, it is found that this relation is significantly moderated by family firm status. Specifically, compared to high family-controlled firms, female involvement negatively impacts firm performance in low family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications From a theoretical standpoint, the results enable a more nuanced interpretation of the relationship between female involvement and firm performance. From a managerial perspective, the results highlight conditions that may promote the role of women in business. Originality/value This paper provides insights into the relation between gender diversity and firm performance by exploring the moderating role of family firm status – a novel approach in the management and wine business literature.},

	abstract = {The dire economic situation in Mexico, with its high rate of unemployment, makes it necessary for many women to find some form of economic activity to provide income for their families. Although such conditions could encourage the creation of new firms, the results of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2006 Report show a gap between the number of women involved in nascent and young entrepreneurship initiatives and the number who owns established firms. This gap may indicate that the firms created need to improve their competitiveness and their ability to survive. The model proposed adopts the resource‐based view of the firm as a theoretical framework from which to study how entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and learning orientation, as well as the interactions between them, influence the achievement of competitive advantage and superior performance in businesses owned by women. Our investigation analyzes businesses established and managed by women in Mexico and registered with the Asociación Mexicana de Mujeres Empresarias A.C. (Mexican Association of Business Women) and the Red de Empresarias del Instituto Nacional de Mujeres (Women Entrepreneurs Network of the National Women's Institute). To gather the information needed, the study used a questionnaire as a measuring instrument. The results are based on the 90 complete answers received from the questionnaires distributed. The results show that all of relationships in our model are positive except the hypothesis that learning orientation mediates in the relationship between market orientation and performance. The results suggest that entrepreneurial orientation reinforces the effect of two capabilities, market orientation and learning orientation, on firm performance. They also reaffirm that the three capabilities assessed may lead an organization to differentiate itself from its competitors by improving its performance. In addition to contributing to the literature on female entrepreneurship, the results have important implications for management. Understanding the relationships between capabilities and the performance of women‐owned businesses in Mexico can permit the identification of areas for improvement to promote the growth and survival of this type of firm.},

Our paper builds on social identity theory to examine the impact of corporate elites—men and women who sit on multiple corporate boards—on board diversity. We extend the main argument of social identity theory concerning favouritism based on homophily by suggesting that boards with men with multiple appointments are unwilling to include female board members to protect the monopoly value generated by their elite status. The empirical analysis, based on DAX 30 firms in the period of 2010–2015, shows that the presence of multi-board men is negatively associated with women’s participation, while the presence of multi-board women and other women on management boards is positively related to gender diversity on boards. Furthermore, robustness tests support and confirm our conclusion that multi-board men have a significant association with board diversity, even with small size (i.e. 1 or 2). Additionally, we find a significant effect arising from pressure related to the introduction of gender quotas in Germany, effective in 2016, indicating the effectiveness of gender quota policies for board gender diversity.},

We use a unique dataset of more than 4000 firms from 58 countries during 2002-2011. Primary analysis surprisingly shows that ESG controversies are associated with greater firm value. However, when interacted with the corporate social performance (CSP) score, ESG controversies are found to have no direct effect on firm value while the interaction appears to be highly and significantly positive. Building on this evidence, we attempt to explore the channels through which CSP may enhance market value. Conducting sample split analysis indicates that higher CSP score has an impact on market value only for high-attention firms, those firms which are larger, perform better, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and have an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, our findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP.},

Moreover, investors can measure the ESG risk exposures of all firms in their portfolios using only stock returns, so that even stocks without qualitative ESG information can be easily considered in the management of ESG risks.

The Hedonic Price Method (HPM) is applied to obtain an evaluation of SRI criteria that is integrated into a multi-objective mathematical programming model. The HPM breaks away from the traditional view that goods are the direct object of utility; on the contrary, it assumes that utility is derived from the properties or characteristics of the goods themselves. As far as the investment decision is concerned, we assume that socially responsible investmentmutual funds (SRI funds) constitute heterogeneous goods. Our approach allows us to obtain a portfolio, the financial performance of which is similar to that which the investor would have reached if he or she had not taken into account social, ethical, and environmental considerations when making his or her investment decisions. This is achieved by designing a two-stage multi-objective mathematical programming procedure. In the first stage, we achieve the maximum level of financial satisfaction that the investor can receive. In the second stage, the portfolio with the best financial-social behavior is built. For the purpose of this second stage, the first stage portfolio is used as a benchmark for the financial performance of a socially responsible portfolio. To apply this methodology, we use portfolios composed of socially responsible and conventional mutual funds domiciled in Spain.},

	abstract = {Modern portfolio theory attempts to maximize the expected return of a portfolio for a given level of portfolio risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return. The reality, however, shows that, when selecting projects to a portfolio and allocating resources in the portfolio, an increasing number of organizations take into account other aspects as well. As a result of the sole purpose (risk-return), it offers only a partial solution for a sustainable organization. Existing project portfolio selection and resource allocation methods and models do not consider sustainability. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a sustainability-oriented model of financial resource allocation in a project portfolio by integrating a composite sustainability index of a project into Markowitz’s classical risk-return scheme (mean-variance model). The model was developed by applying multi-criteria decision-making methods. The practicability of the model was tested by an empirical study in a selected construction company. The proposed sustainability-oriented financial resource allocation model could be used in allocating financial resources in any type of business. The use of the model would not only help organisations to manage risk and achieve higher return but would also allow carrying out sustainable projects, thereby promoting greater environmental responsibility and giving more consideration to the wellbeing of future generations. Moreover, the model allows quantifying the impact of the integration of sustainability into financial resource allocation on the return of a portfolio.},

	abstract = {Developed market economies demonstrate a growing interest in issues concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and its effects, confirmed by the sizeable theoretical and empirical literature on this issue. A substantial research proves also the positive relation between CSR commitment and financial results of banks in mature markets. However, there is less evidence on CSR existence and its impact in other geographical areas, especially in the research concerning Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). In our study we analyze the interrelation between being socially responsible and tangible financial outcome (Corporate Financial Performance—CFP) of banks in the CEEC. The aim is also to empirically verify the relation between efficiency of corporate social-environmental performance (CSP) and the efficiency of CFP for CEEC banks. In our study, we analyze the financial and CSP data of the biggest public banks in CEEC. The researched period is 2012–2016. The empirical part analyzes the interrelation between CSP and CFP based on the panel regression. Moreover, in order to evaluate the CSP efficiency and the CFP efficiency we use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. The empirical results reveal that in case of banks in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region being socially responsible is not reflected in the bottom line. The financial condition of the banks also does not impact the CSR engagement. Our study confirms, however, that CEEC banks with better financial efficiency have higher efficiency of CSR activities. The conclusions may lead to the improved decision-making processes concerning CSR activities and their communication in banks in CEEC.},

People have come to realize that ESG has become an important source of the corporate risk and may affect the company’s financial performance and profitability. Recent research shows that good ESG performance could improve the financial performance in some countries. Yet, the question of “how does ESG affect financial performance” has not been thoroughly discussed and studied in China. In this article, we study China’s listed power generation groups to explore the relationship between ESG performance and financial indicators in the energy power market based on the panel regression model. The results show that good ESG performance can indeed improve financial performance, which has significant meanings for investors, company management, decisionmakers, and industry regulators.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This research employs the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and offers new evidence on the relationship between both types of performance in a sample of companies listed in the Spanish capital market. Financial performance is measured by the return on equity (ROE) ratio, variable that is widely used in Finance and Accounting related research. The corporate performance of the company is measured by its inclusion or not in the sustainability index used as reference for the Spanish capital market, the FTSEGood4 IBEX. The model also incorporates other business variables that might affect the relationships between both types of performance, such as return on assets (ROA) ratio, company size, debt ratio, and industry. The results suggest that, for specific industries, return on assets is a necessary condition for companies with leverage to reduce the cost of debt due to their sustainability profile and consequently boost their ROE.},

Specifically, the ultimate purpose of the comparison is to highlight how CSR may constitute a significant factor of convergence between Islamic and conventional finance systems, going beyond the logic of sustainability in short-term marketing policy and implementing medium- and long-term sustainability. This approach aims at increasing the potential for value creation and the pursuit of economic, social and environmental results for all stakeholders. This convergence should, finally, create conditions favourable to the harmonisation of the regulations and directives relative to CSR in the different countries, and therefore a better integration between Islamic finance institutions and conventional ones in the economic contexts.},

Hence, forecasting the inflation rate of China with a time-varying model may give high accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the problem of forecasting the inflation rate with a functional coefficient autoregressive (FAR) model, which allows the coefficient to change over time. We compare the FAR model based on the B-splines estimation method with the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model by extensive simulation studies. In addition, with the monthly CPI data of China, we conduct both in-sample analysis and out-of-sample forecasting. The forecasting result shows that the FAR model based on the B-splines estimation method has a better performance than the ARMA model.},

The stock market participation puzzle remains unsolved despite the progress in explaining the economic rationality behind investors decision making through behavioral finance. Furthermore, the researchers develop four propositions which can expound the existing relationship between social capital dimensions such as the structural, relational, and cognitive aspects and stock market participation of households. Doing so, we discuss the roles of risk attitude and the influence of cognitive ability such as financial awareness, financial literacy, and IQ (intelligence quotient) to enhance the existing body of knowledge. Practically, this article adds valuable ideas in solving the issue of limited participation not just in the stock market but in other financial markets through reflecting on the sociological and (green) technological concepts.

This paper provides simulations and estimations of the optimal scale of foreign exchange reserves under the background of possible shocks to China\&rsquo;s economy due to the further opening of China\&rsquo;s financial market and the sudden stop of capital inflows. Focused on the perspective of financial security, this article tentatively constructs an optimal scale analysis framework that is based on a utility maximization of the foreign exchange reserve, and selects relevant data to simulate the optimal scale of China\&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves. The results show that: (1) the main reason for the fast growth of the Chinese foreign exchange reserve scale is the structural trouble of its double international payment surplus, which creates long-term appreciation expectations for the exchange rate that make it difficult for international capital inflows and excess foreign exchange reserves to enter the real economic growth mechanism under the model of China\&rsquo;s export-driven economy growth; (2) the average optimal scale of the foreign exchange reserve in case of the sudden stop of capital inflows was calculated through parameter estimation and numerical simulation to be 13.53\% of China\&rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) between 1994 and 2017; (3) with the function of the foreign exchange reserves changing from meeting basic transaction demands to meeting financial security demands, the effect of the foreign exchange reserve maintaining the state\&rsquo;s financial security is becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, the structure of foreign exchange reserve assets should be optimized in China, and we will give full play to the special role of foreign exchange reserve in safeguarding a country\&rsquo;s financial security.},

The model suggests that access to the Internet can effectively mitigate financing difficulty of firms by alleviating information asymmetry and reducing agency cost, and thus can promote the sustainable development of those firms. The model also shows that access to the Internet can improve social welfare based on aforementioned mechanism. Using China household finance data from China Household Finance Survey, we tested the impact of access to the Internet on access to finance of small and micro businesses. Our empirical results confirm the positive role played by access to the Internet in alleviating financing difficulty of those firms. Moreover, we also found evidence that access to the Internet can reduce borrowers’ dependence on physical branches of banks when making bank choice decision for loan applications. Our evidence also implies that access to the Internet is conducive to the sustainable development of small and micro businesses via mitigating their financing difficulty.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Specifically, in the good state, the weekly SCDS spread changes are mainly determined by local, regional and fundamental factors; whereas global variables have a stronger influence in the bad regime. In particular, US market returns play a dominant role in influencing the SCDS spread change in the bad state suggesting loss aversion and flight–to–quality behavior of investors. We then examine the cross-sectional differences of the above regime switching effect based on country-specific characters and find that the regime switching effect is associated with a nation’s country-specific characters such as openness, economic size and so forth.},

Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon and the higher their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. Overall, our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important as a tool for additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers.},

However, it decreases with increase in balanced fund flows suggesting rational investment behaviour of balanced mutual funds. In addition, equity funds follow the market volatility positively, suggesting pos- itive feedback trading (momentum) behaviour. On the other hand, balanced funds follow mar- ket volatility negatively and exhibit negative feedback trading behaviour (contrarian behaviour).

The model nests numerous ones currently in use, and is shown to outperform all its special cases. In particular, an extensive out-of-sample risk forecasting exercise for seven major FX and equity indices confirms the superiority of the general model compared to its special cases and other competitors. Estimation issues related to problems associated with mixture models are discussed, and a new, general, method is proposed to successfully circumvent these. The model is straightforwardly extended to the multivariate setting by using an independent component analysis framework.

(a) We find strong and robust evidence of LRD for CTR in developed markets and somewhat weaker evidence in emerging markets. Considering that CTR are vital components of modern financial models, these results have far-reaching consequences because, in the presence of LRD, traditional asset pricing methods/tests are no longer valid. (b) We also show that portfolios focusing on only the most persistent carry trades (highest Hurst coefficients among the ones above 0.5) can significantly outperform their all-encompassing counterparts. This implies that Hurst coefficients contain important investment information which can be used to enhance the performance of practical carry trade strategies.},

This paper examines the relationship between corporate sustainability disclosure and return on investment. The sample of this study consisted of ten Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)-listed mining companies, and the data was extracted from sustainability reports for a period of five years from 2010 to 2014. In this regard, data collection was undertaken by the adoption of a content analysis approach. A multi-regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental disclosure and return on investment. The same statistical mechanism was employed to determine the association involving social disclosure and return on investment. Results show that there is a negative relationship between environmental disclosure and return on investment. On the other hand, the research reveals that there is also a positive association between social disclosure and return on investment. This implies that an increase in corporate reporting of social issues results in heightened financial performance through an increase in return on investment. This study recommends the adoption of corporate social disclosure as it will encourage firms to be socially responsible, while also generating financial benefits. Further studies can be conducted about the change from voluntary corporate social disclosure to mandatory disclosure.},

	abstract = {We argue that the majority of the current approaches in research on corporate sustainability are inconsistent with the notion of sustainable development. By defining the notion of instrumentality in the context of corporate sustainability through three conceptual principles we show that current approaches are rooted in a bounded notion of instrumentality which establishes a systematic a priori predominance of economic organizational outcomes over environmental and social aspects. We propose an inclusive notion of profitability that reflects the return on all forms of environmental, social, and economic capital used by a firm. This inclusive notion of corporate profitability helps to redefine corporate profitability as if sustainability matters in that it overcomes the bounded instrumentality that impairs current research on corporate sustainability. We apply this notion to different car manufacturers and develop conceptual implications for future research on corporate sustainability. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The authors discuss the benefits of considering material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors when investing in emerging and frontier markets. Companies that operate in these markets face a myriad of operating challenges, and management teams that respond to such challenges effectively can achieve superior financial performance over time. They are able to grow faster, achieve higher profitability, reduce their cost of capital, and manage exogenous risks better than their peers. For investment managers, integrating sustainability into the analysis process provides a differentiated lens to identify companies that possess strong competitive advantages that can drive value creation over time. At the same time, it can help investment managers avoid companies that have embedded risks in their business model or operations that may not be entirely visible to the market. Finally, given the early‐stage nature of many of these markets and the sometimes uneven understanding of sustainability issues at a company level, the authors argue that active ownership can be an important driver of alpha generation by fund managers. Engaging constructively with board members and management teams to improve a company's ESG profile can help drive operational improvements, strengthen the risk management function, and upgrade investors' perception of the quality of the management team.},

	abstract = {The profitability of a firm is a highly complex concept, as it results from firms' decisions on investment and production plans, but also from constraints beyond their control (economic regulation, level of competition, economic growth). We analyze the profitability of firms in the water industry by focusing on the impact of economic regulation and the economic environment. The objective is to determine empirical regularities which could explain profitability. Using a panel of firms from developed and transition countries, we show that the profitability of firms in the water sector is in line with that in other network industries. Profitability varies greatly depending on the chosen measure of profitability, firm's size, the economic environment and the characteristics of regulation in place are essential to understand and explain firm's profitability. In particular, being regulated by a price-cap scheme appears to be an important determinant of profitability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The statistical model is run on 17,358 observations and studies the association of ROA and the three different dimensions of ESG score. Significant differences between industrial firms and financial intermediaries emerge.

They consider two standard volatility investments: implied volatility and volatility risk premium strategies. An analytical framework, which offers pragmatic solutions for longterm investors who seek exposure to volatility, is used to calibrate and assess the risk - return profiles of portfolios.The benefit of volatility exposure for a conventional portfolio is shown through a mean-modified Value at Risk portfolio optimization. A pure volatility investment makes it possible to partially hedge downside equity risk and thus reduce the risk profile of a portfolio, while an investment in the volatility risk premium substantially increases returns for a given level of risk. A well-calibrated combination of the two strategies enhances both the absolute and risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio.},

These topics present a path traveled by earlier work, but there are gains in studying together all 47 volatility-based indices that are now available, in order to examine if different asset classes and financial instruments could possess different return-volatility relations and forecasting ability. Our findings suggest that implied volatility includes information about future volatility beyond that contained in past volatility; this finding is consistent across all assets under review. Furthermore, we find a significant contemporaneous relationship between implied volatility changes and underlying returns, but at the same time, we show that implied volatilities in commodities, bonds, currencies and volatility react differently to underlying price changes compared to equities. Hence, our findings have important implications for asset allocation, risk management and asset pricing.},

For example, the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index had a maximum drawdown of approximately 25\% of its value in 2008, with some of its sub-indexes dropping almost 60\%. The drop in commodities was even more significant. The S\&P GSCI commodity index experienced a maximum drawdown of about 2/3 of its value in 2008. In stark contrast, volatility levels as measured by VIX experienced significant increases and in 2008 repeatedly set new highs not seen since the crash of 1987.

This manner of calculating the VIX emerged in September of 2003 and is documented with an example by the CBOE. In this paper, the calculation of the VIX is reproduced in an Excel template to automate and to some degree simplify the calculation. Further, one can also apply other option series to calculate a VIX-type analysis for the underlying security which is of great benefit because the calculation is independent of option pricing model biases. 2 INTRODUCTION:},

We compare the predic-tive accuracy of a large set of sentiment analysis models using a sample of articles that have been rated by humans on a positivity/negativity scale. The results highlight the gains from combining existing lexicons and from accounting for negation. We also generate our own sentiment-scoring model, which includes a new lexicon built specifically to capture the sentiment in economic news articles. This model is shown to have better predictive accuracy than existing, "off-the-shelf", models. Lastly, we provide two applications to the economic research on sentiment. First, we show that daily news sentiment is predictive of movements of survey-based measures of consumer sentiment. Second, motivated by Barsky and Sims (2012), we estimate the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to sentiment shocks, finding that positive sentiment shocks increase consumption, output, and interest rates and dampen inflation. * We thank Armen Berjikly and the Kanjoya and Ultimate Software staff for generously assisting on the project and providing guidance, comments and suggestions.},

Under-standing the properties of carbon price returns is especially crucial for industries which have to comply with an emission trading system and other market participants such as risk managers and speculators. We therefore seek to develop accurate models which capture the behavior of carbon price returns comprehensively. We apply a broad spec-trum of GARCH model specifications, using different distributions for model innova-tions. As both time series, spot and futures price returns, exhibit asymmetric behav-ior in their variance, we additionally take Markov regime switching models for the variance equation into consideration. Empirical results demonstrate that AGARCH, NARCH and GJR fit the data best. We further show that, in the error term of any model, fat-tailed distributions—in particular the generalized error distribution—significantly improve the fit. Additionally, as futures returns seem to carry informational content concerning subsequent spot returns, we propose a sound, yet parsimonious, spot returns model, well-suited to capturing the dynamics. Finally, the most appropriate models for spot and futures price returns are tested in an out-of-sample environment, and further checked for robustness in data subsets. Subsequently a model for each market is proposed.},

This paper introduces a Spanish Financial Market Stress Indicator (FMSI), similar to the “Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress” that Holló et al. (2012) proposed for the euro area as a whole. This indicator, which represents a real-time measure of systemic risk, tries to quantify stress in the Spanish financial system and describes the contribution of each financial mar- ket segment (bond market, equity market, money market, financial intermediaries, forex markets and derivatives) to the total stress in the system. The methodology takes into account time-varying corre- lations between market segments. The study analyses the ability of the FMSI to identify past periods of high financial stress and presents two econometric approaches with the aim of classifying observa- tions into different stress regimes and of determining if financial stress has a negative impact on the real economy},

Method: We construct and analyze a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) for Mexi-co using the principal components methodology. Accordingly, we included 30 variables related to the behavior of the financial markets. We classified them into nine groups: short and long-term interest rates; foreign exchange, stock, derivative , and credit markets; risk premium; private debt; and inflation expectations. Results: The results show that this FCI adequately captures moments of astringency in financial markets in Mexico, such as the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the crisis in Europe in mid-2011, the beginning of the "tapering talk" in the United States in the second half of 2013, among others. Conclusion: The proposed FCI for Mexico works as a tool to supervise the evolution of the financial stress and to identify in which components of the financial markets there are signs of astringency.},

This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility. 2006 by The American Finance Association.},

	abstract = {Many writers have commented on the heterogeneity of the socially responsible investment (SRI) movement. However, few have actually tried to understand and explain it, and even fewer have discussed whether the opposite – standardisation – is possible and desirable. In this article, we take a broader perspective on the issue of the heterogeneity of SRI. We distinguish between four levels on which heterogeneity can be found: the terminological, definitional, strategic and practical. Whilst there is much talk about the definitional ambiguities of SRI, we suggest that there is actually some agreement on the definitional level. There are at least three explanations which we suggest can account for the heterogeneity on the other levels: cultural and ideological differences between different regions, differences in values, norms and ideology between various SRI stakeholders, and the market setting of SRI. Discussing the implications of the three explanations for the SRI market, we suggest that there is reason to be sceptical about the possibilities of standardisation if not standardisation is imposed top-down. Whether this kind of standardisation is desirable or not, we argue, depends on what the motives for it would be. To the extent that standardisation may facilitate the mainstreaming of SRI, it could be a good thing – but we entertain doubts about whether mainstreaming really requires standardisation.},

There was a significant moderating effect on the relationship between subjective norms and perceived behavioural control towards an intention to SRI among more experienced fund managers. There was also a significant moderating effect on the relationship between subjective norms and caring ethical climate towards an intention to SRI among small-sized fund managers. At behavioural level, there was a significant moderating effect on the relationship between moral intensity and SRI behaviour among less experienced fund managers. There was also a significant moderating effect on the relationship between moral intensity and caring ethical climate on SRI behaviour among bigger-sized fund managers. This paper conduits the literature gap by expanding the understanding on the moderating impact of experience and size of fund towards SRI, provides insights to policy makers in carrying out appropriate talent development strategies in accumulating the support of fund managers towards SRI-related initiatives in the capital market, and reveals the potential contribution of fund manager talent management in sustainable development through SRI. The paper offers vision on fund manager talent management to forefront the progress of SRI in emerging economies.},

We analyze returns during 1992-2007 of stocks rated on social responsibility by KLD and find that this tilt gave socially responsible investors a return advantage relative to conventional investors. However, typical socially responsible investors also shun stocks of companies associated with tobacco, alcohol, gambling, firearms, military, and nuclear operations. We find that such shunning brought to socially responsible investors a return disadvantage relative to conventional investors. The return advantage of tilts toward stocks of companies with high social responsibility scores is largely offset by the return disadvantage that comes from the exclusion of stocks of 'shunned' companies. The return of the DS 400 Index of socially responsible companies was approximately equal to the return of the S\&P 500 Index of conventional companies.    Socially responsible investors can do both well and good by adopting the best-in-class method in the construction of their portfolios. That method calls for tilts toward stocks of companies with high scores on social responsibility characteristics, but refrains from calls to shun the stock of any company, even one that produces tobacco.},

Arguing within a theoretical model of a fixed exchange rate system that allows for multiple equilibria, we show that the crisis, although associated with weak fundamentals, cannot be explained by these macroeconomic factors alone.

	abstract = {This paper examines the effect of sustainability performance of European corporations on their stock performance, measured as the average monthly stock return from 1996 to 2001. The econometric analysis is based on common empirical asset pricing models, particularly on the multifactor model according to Fama and French (1993, Journal of Financial Economics, 33:3-56). The consideration of sustainability performance is twofold: The average sustainability performance of the industry in which a corporation operates and the relative sustainability performance of a corporation within a given industry. The main result is that the average environmental performance of the industry has a significantly positive influence on the stock performance. In contrast, the average social performance of the industry has a significantly negative influence. The variables of the relative environmental or social performance of a corporation within a given industry have no significant effect on the stock performance. As a by-product, the econometric analysis implies that some results of Fama and French (1993, 1996, The Journal of Finance, LI (1):55-84) regarding the risk factors of the multifactor model need not hold true for different observation periods, for different stock markets, and for the use of single stocks (instead of portfolios).},

This research is based on a comparative descriptive analysis of the public information provided by the most representative ESG rating and information provider agencies in the financial market in two periods: 2008 and 2018. The findings show that ESG rating agencies have integrated new criteria into their assessment models to measure corporate performance more accurately and robustly in order to respond to new global challenges. However, a deep analysis of the criteria also shows that ESG rating agencies do not fully integrate sustainability principles into the corporate sustainability assessment process.},

The overall results of this research are consistent with the value enhancing theory (as opposed with the shareholder expense theory). From the ESG factors, the governance factor seems to have the most important influence on the market value of the selected companies, regardless of the geographic region where they are located.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies have emerged in response to the needs of SRI actors for reliable data on the social performance of firms. Since 2005, the ESG rating industry has witnessed a number of national and cross-border consolidations. Based on a set of 37 interviews and secondary data, the paper explores the driving forces behind this consolidation as well as its impact. Our focus is on four ESG rating agencies, based in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland. We conclude that in effect consolidation has at least partially resulted in institutional retrogression, whereby the traditional norms and values have reaffirmed their primacy, thereby somewhat negating the institutional change sought by the SRI movement.

Laggards in terms of environmental sustainability commitment are likely to face fines and penalties as talks to tighten environmental legislation are now at an advanced stage globally. The current work assessed the link between environmental sustainability commitment and financial performance of firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The study was quantitative in nature with a case study research design. The longitudinal design was adopted where the researcher collected panel data from 2011-2018. The population of the study included all firms listed on the JSE Responsible Investment Index in South Africa. The sample constituted of 32 firms listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange FTSE/JSE Responsible Investment Index in South Africa. The researchers employed the panel regression analysis model to analyze the data. Specifically, the Feasible Generalized Least Squares regression model was used in this study. Financial performance was treated as the dependent variable as measured by earnings per share and share price. The independent variables of the study included components of environmental sustainability such as carbon emission reduction and environmental compliance. Control variables such as firm size and liquidity were used in the study. The findings indicated that carbon emission reduction was positively and significantly related to earnings per share and share price. The findings further exhibited that environmental compliance was positively related to earnings per share and share price. It was concluded that firms can enhance their financial performance from environmental investment as all the hypotheses were supported. This study contributes practically towards shaping environmental policies and it also serves as motivation to listed companies that they can enhance both their profitability and market value from environmental investments.},

Apart from agriculture, industry is viewed as the second largest user of water and can, therefore, have a significant impact on the saving of water. The purpose of this research is to investigate how selected South African listed mining companies are measuring, managing, and disclosing their water risks, as well as engaging with stakeholders. The selection of the mining companies was made using the companies with the highest market capitalisation figures of those that have a primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The sustainability/integrated/annual reports for 2013 were reviewed using the Ceres Aqua Gauge™ (Boston, MA, USA) as the framework. The findings of this research were that the selected mining companies had grasped the seriousness of the water crisis in South Africa, and the effects it will have on their businesses in future. Most concerning was the activities relating to water management in the supply chain; all of the selected mining companies were found to have no evidence of this in their reports, subsequently this is an area that needs to be addressed in future research.},

Using a novel measure of CSR report quality, we examine the impact of certain national, legal, and firm-level factors that might explain differences in the overall quality and extent of coverage of various issues in these reports. Our findings show that legal factors and CSR environment in a firm's country of headquarters play an important role in firms' CSR reporting quality. Common law countries exhibit systematically higher overall CSR reporting quality than code law countries. Countries with higher CSR standards, policies, and regulations in place also produce significantly higher quality CSR reports. Firm size, on the other hand, has no major impact on the overall quality of CSR reports. In further analysis of the individual aspects of CSR disclosures, namely environment, philanthropy, bribery and corruption, and integrity assurance, we document that larger firms report at a higher quality on philanthropy and bribery and corruption. Bribery and corruption is reported at a higher quality in countries with common law tradition, high-quality legal regimes, and high CSR standards and regulations in place. We also observe higher quality integrity assurance in common law countries. CSR-minded countries and countries with low-quality legal environment also report on philanthropy at a higher quality. Finally, we offer guidelines for companies toward improving the quality of their reports, and suggestions for scholars and researchers for further avenues of research.},

The study entails an analysis of ESG performance in sensitive industries (i.e., those subject to systematic social taboos, moral debates, and political pressures and those that are more likely to cause social and environmental damage). To test our hypotheses, we applied linear regressions with a data panel using the Thomson Reuters Eikon™ database to analyze data from 365 listed companies selected from BRICS between 2010 and 2012. The results suggest that companies in sensitive industries present superior environmental performance, even when controlling for the firm's size and country.

This makes a triple bottom line (TBL) approach to investment decision making possible. We apply our measures to the worldwide chemical sector and validate them. Moreover, we propose a 2D graphical sustainability analysis, which is simple and easy for investors to understand when making investment decisions and can be used if they are concerned about environmental and social matters.

	abstract = {Freshwater sustainability has been emerging as a critical corporate social responsibility issue for leading businesses worldwide. An increasing number of companies disclose and evaluate their water footprint, embracing an end-to-end supply chain perspective. In this work, we first propose a strategic system dynamics model for capturing the long-term impact of various water management policies on consumptive water footprint and supply chain profitability under diverse scenarios of consumers' demand patterns depending on blue water-related efficiency (i.e. green market behaviours). We apply the proposed simulation model on a specific wine supply chain and demonstrate that, under specific green market behaviour conditions, technological interventions in agriculture (e.g. drip irrigation) are more environmentally and economically sustainable compared to industrial water recycling and reuse, while the combined application of both policies is even more effective. Additionally, the impact of water-efficient policies on supply chain financial performance is even more potent under increased consumers' environmental sensitivity. Based on the managerial insights obtained from our analysis, as well as current corporate drivers and goals, we finally propose a supporting methodological framework for the ex-ante evaluation of eco-efficient supply chain water management policies, considering the impact of the green market behaviour on water-related and economic sustainability.},

Using a sample of Korean firms covering the period 2011–2012, and employing two different test methods, namely the OLS and 2SLS methods, we show that the relationships between environmental responsibility performance and firms’ ROE and ROA are positive and statistically significant. However, we show that research and development (R\&D) intensity (expenditure) does not affect either environmental responsibility or corporate financial performance.

An exploratory research analyzes whether these methods are identifying and/or driving more SBMs that contribute to promote the creation of sustainable value, seeking to generate economic, social, and environmental value. Results indicate that ESG rating agencies identify the short-term results in the internal organizational perspective mainly in the environmental dimension, whereas social aspects are emphasized from the external organizational perspective. However, ESG rating agencies are not driving a more SBMs that must integrate ESG criteria in a holistic way with a short-term and long-term perspective.},

	volume = {21},
	issn = {09648410},
	doi = {10.1111/corg.12028},
	abstract = {A critical issue for the future growth of socially responsible investment (SRI) is to what extent institutional investors such as pension funds can be persuaded to engage in it. This paper considers attempts at justifying such engagement stemming from a range of (re-)interpretations of the fiduciary duties owed by pension funds to their beneficiaries, and thereby develops a hypothesis concerning the most effective political or legal remedy. Previous commentary suggests that fiduciary duty either already mandates SRI for pension funds, or at least can be made to do so rather easily. In contrast with this, however, this paper finds that none of the considered interpretations is able to justify engagement on social and environmental issues across the board. Indeed, the problem to some extent seems rooted in the very concept of fiduciary duty. The paper is relevant to current attempts at justifying SRI through reinterpretations of fiduciary duty, provided mainly by legal scholars and practitioners. By addressing the more philosophical issue of how far the concept of fiduciary duty can be "stretched" to accommodate SRI (a project of conceptual rather than legal clarification), it provides an evaluation of the contemporary debate which is independent of squabbles about existing law. The paper shows that there are conceptual limits to attempts at redefining fiduciary duty. But this does not mean that pension funds' engagement in SRI is unjustified or unjustifiable more generally. A more promising way to legally mandate SRI may be through what is dubbed independent social and environmental obligations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In this study, we examine the time-varying correlations between carbon allowance prices with other financial indices, during the third phase of EU-ETS. The results show that, at the beginning of this period, carbon price was still strongly corrected with other financial indices. However, this connection was weakened over time. Given the relative independence of carbon assets from other financial assets, we argue for the diversification benefits of including carbon assets in financial portfolios, and building such portfolios, respectively, with the traditional global minimum variance (GMV) strategy, the mean-variance-OGARCH (MV-OGARCH) strategy, and the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) strategy. It is shown that the portfolio built with the MV-OGARCH strategy far out-performs the others and that including carbon assets in financial portfolios does help reduce investment risks.},

Based on cross-sectional linear regressions and non-linear threshold regressions of 713 banks from 75 countries over the period 2013–2015, we find that access to finance has significantly positive effects on banks’ financial performance in most estimation models controlling for both bank-specific and macroeconomic variables. The positive impact on financial performance is channeled through loan growth and management quality. We find that for banks with total assets less than USD 2 billion, access to finance has a significantly positive impact on return to equity. The paper concludes by discussing policy implications.},

In the case of the more aggressive type of pension funds (those with a higher Mexican equity investment level), a lower mean-variance efficiency would have been observed had these invested in the IPC sustainable index. We also found, with a two-regime Markov-switching analysis, that socially responsible investment would have been better for most of these pension funds during distress time periods. Even if our results do not give strong short-term proof for the use of a socially responsible investment strategy in the most aggressive pension funds, we found that the benefits will be observed in the long-term, due to a better performance during distress time periods and the lag effect of mid and small-cap stocks in the performance.},

A review of 190 academic papers spanning the period from 1975 to mid-2009 was conducted. This exploratory study evaluated the associations and disassociations of the primary name assigned to this genre of investment with variables grouped into five domains, namely Primary Ethical Position, Investment Strategy, Publication Date, Regions Covered and Periodical Type. The study indicated that papers coded as expressing a deontological ethical position were more frequently associated with the name Ethical Investment, whereas those with an ambiguous ethical position were less frequently associated with Ethical Investment. Three investment strategies (positive screening, best-in-class and causebased investing) were unusually associated with the primary name Responsible Investment. A strong preference for the name Ethical Investment was noted in the United Kingdom, and contrasted starkly with an apparent aversion for this name in the United States. The name Ethical Investment is significantly more frequently used in journals dealing with ethics, business ethics and philosophy than in finance, economic and investment journals. Finally, the study yielded some weak hints that the name Responsible Investment might perhaps be linked to an egoist ethical position. On the basis of this, and because these have already been substantively linked through the Principles for Responsible Investment in the popular discourse, we follow the heuristic tradition set by Sparkes (Business Ethics Eur Rev 10:194–201, 2001), and propose that Responsible Investment be defined as ‘Investment practices that integrate a consideration of ESG issues with the primary purpose of delivering higher-risk-adjusted financial returns’.},

In order to determine the validity of corporate efficiency measurement a model of three linear regressions with panel data was designed. This model tests whether the environmental (E), social performance (S) and corporate governance (G) variables of the studied companies are able to explain their profitability for the period 2014–2017. Results show that sustainable value (S) explains profitability—or return on sales (ROS)—with a high degree of significance, whereas it explains corporate efficiency to a moderate extent. Likewise, corporate governance (G) is the most significant variable for the generation of sustainable value. We conclude that generating sustainable value allows firms to meet profitability goals and to mitigate environmental and social impacts. Thus, the model is useful for measuring corporate efficiency in sustainable companies.},

Two goals are considered, the traditional financial goal in the classical utility theory under uncertainty and an ethical goal in the same utility framework. A new financial-ethical bi-criteria model is proposed with absolute risk aversion coefficients and targets depending on the investor's ethical profile. This approach is relevant as an increasing number of mutual funds are becoming interested in SRI strategies. From the proposed model, an actual case on green investment is developed. Concerning this case (without generalizing to other contexts), an analysis of the numerical results shows that efficient portfolios obtained by the traditional E-V model outperform the strong green portfolios in terms of expected return and risk, but this does not significantly occur with weak green investment.},

A numerical example is presented in order to illustrate the proposed model.

At the same time, a number of scientific papers have been published on socially responsible investments (SRIs), covering a broad range of topics, from what actually defines SRIs to the financial performance of SRI funds in contrast to non-SRI funds. In this paper, we revisit Markowitz’ Portfolio Selection Theory and propose a modification allowing to incorporate not only asset-specific return and risk but also a social responsibility measure into the investment decision making process. Applied in an a posteriori fashion, the model results in a three-dimensional capital allocation plane illustrating the complete set of feasible optimal portfolios. It enables investors to custom–tailor their asset allocations and incorporate all personal preferences regarding return, risk and social responsibility. In an empirical analysis with a data set of over 6000 international companies (including the complete universe of social responsibility-rated stocks), we find that investors opting to maximize the social impact of their investments do indeed face a statistically significant decrease in expected returns. However, the social responsibility/risk-optimal portfolio yields a statistically significant higher social responsibility rating than the return/risk-optimal portfolio.},

	abstract = {Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs) have become increasingly popular over the past decade. The majority of the literature focuses on SRI performance (versus conventional investments), content and related evaluation-screening techniques. Even though numerous terms with differing focus have been coined (e.g. sustainable, environmental, ethical, and social investments) to describe the rationale for SRIs, they all pertain to one all-encompassing SRIs definition. This undermines the accuracy and robustness of current measurement techniques as only certain aspects of the overall SRIs performance are assessed. The purpose of this paper is threefold: Firstly, a mapping of SRIs terminology according to the focus areas is provided followed by a classification for Socially Responsible Investors based on underlying motivational factors. A narrative literature review has been conducted for SRIs relying on the triple-bottom-line approach. It concludes with a mapping of SRIs territory by outlining seven distinct SRI categories for investors’ motivations and also offers a classification with ten types of SRIs. Thirdly, a discussion regarding the relationship between SRIs and cleaner production is presented. The finding shows that there is a dichotomy in the field of SRIs. Some types of investors move to SRIs mainly to exploit new financial opportunities or to avoid potential risks regarding the environmental and social aspects of sustainability while value-based investors are willing to invest money in firms and projects with an environmental, social and ethical orientation.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes how different combinations of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) dimensions affect corporate economic performance. We use various dimensions of CSR to examine whether firms rely on different combinations of CSR, in terms of quality versus quantity of CSR practices. Our empirical analysis based on an original database including 10,293 French firms shows that different CSR dimensions in isolation impact positively firms' profits but their effect in term on intensity varies among CSR dimensions. Moreover, the findings on the qualitative CSR measure, based on interaction between its dimensions, show that the substitutability of these dimensions is highly significant for firm performance. However, in terms of the intensity, those interactions produce differential effects. Actually, asking whether a firm starting with a certain configuration cannot perform better by adding or removing some dimension(s) we found that only one configuration fulfills this requirement: green and HR. The interpretation is that when a firm starts with this configuration then it is better not to move to another configuration. In all other configurations, firms can always improve their profits either by adding or removing some dimensions. Finally, the profitability of CSR investments in French firms seems to rely on a specific qualitative mix of different CSR dimensions rather than a pure quantitative approach accumulating practices without designing a consistent set of interactions among them.},

Governance information disclosure has the strongest positive linkage with corporate efficiency, followed by social and environmental information disclosure. Moreover, we explored the relationship between particular ESG activities and corporate financial performance (CFP), including corporate efficiency, return on assets, and market value. We found that most of the ESG activities reveal a nonnegative relationship with CFP.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between firms' Corporate Social Responsibility activities and their economic performance, taking into account seven macro-categories of corporate social responsibility (CSR), six market-based and accounting-based performance indicators and by disaggregating for the firms' sector of activity. In particular, through a representative sample of 988 US-based companies from nine different sectors (Basic Materials, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services, Financials, Health Care, Industrial, Oil \& Gas, Technology and Utilities), we study the dynamics of possible endogenous and non-linear relationships through the Arellano-Bond technique in the dynamic panel. The results show some common patterns and sectorial specificities—CSR engagement in general raises firms' total stock returns and reduces financial risks, but this depends on the area of CSR in which the firms invest. The results of an accounting-based figure analysis are less univocal, showing patterns that depend both on the specific area of CSR and the sectorial activities conducted.},

We develop and test two competing hypotheses of risk reduction and window dressing. Employing an extensive U. S. sample during the 1991-2010 period from controversial industry firms, such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and others, we find that CSR engagement inversely affects firm risk after controlling for various firm characteristics. To deal with endogeneity issue, we adopt a system equation approach and difference regressions and continue to find that CSR engagement of firms in controversial industry sectors negatively affects firm risk. To examine the premise that firm risk is more of an issue for controversial firms, we further examine the difference between non-controversial and controversial firm samples, and find that the effect of risk reduction through CSR engagement is more economically and statistically significant in controversial industry firms than in non-controversial industry firms. These findings support the risk-reduction hypothesis, but not the window-dressing hypothesis, and the notion that the top management of U. S. firms in controversial industries is, in general, risk averse and that their CSR engagement helps their risk management efforts. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Does a company that strives to attain good environmental performance decrease its market risk or is environmental performance just a disadvantageous cost that increases such risk levels for these firms? Answers to this question have important implications for the management of companies and the investment decisions of individuals and institutions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between corporate environmental performance and firm risk in the British context. Using the largest dataset assembled so far, with community and environmental responsibility (CER) rankings for all rated UK companies between 1994 and 2006, we show that a company's environmental performance is inversely related to its systematic financial risk. However, an increase of 1.0 in the CER score is associated with only a 0.028 reduction in its β. © 2011 The Authors.},

In addition, the link between CSP and investor utility is investigated. The main findings are that corporate social responsibility is negatively but weakly related to systematic firm risk and that corporate social irresponsibility is positively and strongly related to financial risk. The fact that both conventional and downside risk measures lead to the same conclusions adds convergent validity to the analysis. However, the risk-return trade-off appears to be such that no clear utility gain or loss can be realized by investing in firms characterized by different levels of social and environmental performance. Overall volatility conditions of the financial markets are shown to play a moderating role in the nature and strength of the CSP-risk relationship. © 2012 Financial Management Association International.},

This research develops hypotheses regarding the opposing influence of corporate reputation on a firm's systematic risk, unsystematic risk and total risk, as well as the moderation effect of firm size and industry concentration. Using a panel data method, these relationships are analysed, controlling for the effects of endogeneity, for a sample of Spanish quoted firms in the period 2001-2007. Specifically, two complementary analyses are performed. The first distinguishes firms included and not included in the MERCO index of the most reputable firms. The second analyses the impact of corporate reputation for the sub-sample of most reputable firms. Being reputable reduces a firm's unsystematic risk and total risk, but increases systematic risk. In addition, firm size weakens these influences of corporate reputation on firm risk. However, among the most reputable firms, differences in reputation score have a lower effect on risk. Specifically, the corporate reputation level only influences firm unsystematic risk. © 2011 The Author(s). British Journal of Management © 2011 British Academy of Management.},

Specifically, based upon a panel dataset of 334 Chinese listed firms operating in highly water-sensitive industries during 2010–2015, we use regression models to analyze the relationships between water disclosure and three types of firm risk (i.e., total risk, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk) and the moderating effects of media coverage on these relationships. Our empirical results show that (a) although there are no significant relationships between water disclosure and total risk and idiosyncratic risk, there is a significant negative relationship between water disclosure and systematic risk; (b) negative media coverage weakens the negative relationship between water disclosure and systematic risk, whereas nonnegative media coverage reinforces this negative relationship. Our cornerstone study examines the effect of a specific type of environmental disclosure (i.e., water disclosure) on firm risk, and our empirical findings are different from previous studies, which examined the effects of overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure on firm risk. We analyze the causes of the differences in detail. With this study, we make theoretical, empirical, and managerial contributions to CSR disclosure–firm risk research in business ethics literature.},

	abstract = {Research summary: This article explores the relationship between corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and financial risk. We posit that media coverage of CSI generates risk by providing conditions that increase the potential for stakeholder sanctions. Through analyzing an international panel of 539 firms during 2008–2013, we find that firms receiving higher CSI coverage face higher financial risk. We show that the reach of the reporting media outlet is a critical condition for this relationship. Once the outlet has a high reach, the severity of CSI coverage is a boundary condition that further reinforces the effect. Our findings complement existing theory about the risk-mitigating effect of corporate social responsibility by illuminating the risk-generating effect of CSI coverage. For executives, these insights suggest complementary strategies for corporate risk management. Managerial summary: This article examines the effect of negative news on financial risk. It shows that negative media articles regarding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues increase a firm's credit risk. It also provides a detailed analysis of the impact of an article's reach and severity, i.e., how many readers are exposed to the article and how harshly it criticizes the firm. The results allow to quantitatively assess the risk that emanates from negative ESG news. For executives, three strategies are derived for limiting a firm's exposure to this risk: balancing corporate social responsibility programs with operational safety programs, reporting suboptimal environmental and social performance transparently and proactively, and avoiding acquisition targets and markets with a legacy of negative news.

I define the staleness of a news story as its textual similarity to the previous ten stories about the same firm. I find that firms' stock returns respond less to stale news.

The subsequent return reversal is significantly larger in stocks with above-average individual investor trading activity. These results are consistent with the idea that individual investors overreact to stale information, leading to temporary movements in firms' stock prices. © The Author 2011.},

Further, most studies of this question rely solely on the views of investorswho already invest in SRI funds.Our study surveys a unique pool of approximately 5,000 investors that contains both investors who have used SRI criteria in investment decisions and thosewho have not, and involves a broad array of criteria associated with SR investing. Our findings offer new insight into the SRI debate. For both sets of investors, environmental and sustainability issues dominate as the major category associated with SR investing. We find strong agreement in the ranking of the relative importance of various SRI factors despite differences between these two groups in their opinion of their overall importance. We also find that investors prefer to consider theSRI question inmore holistic terms rather than using the exclusionary format favored bymost SRI funds. Investors seem to prefer to reward firms who display overall positive social behavior rather than to exclude firms on the basis of certain products or practices. These findings can help providers of SR investment vehicles to improve the SRI products that they offer to the general investor, thus both encouraging the initial adoption of SR criteria by investors and increasing overall investment in SR choices.},

	abstract = {Freshwater scarcity is no longer limited to sub-Saharan developing countries; also in Western society, access to unlimited amounts of freshwater is not assured at all times. It has been argued - and laid down in many national legal systems - that access to freshwater is a basic human right. What if corporate freshwater use threatens to interfere with this human right? The main focus of the article is to explore the role of todays companies in relation to freshwater. A number of tools have been developed to attend to the necessity to reduce corporate use of freshwater. The article discusses specialised water reporting instruments such as the 2007 Global Water Tool and the water footprint calculation method. In addition, attention is paid to a CERES report (2010) revealing that the majority of the 100 worlds leading companies in water-intensive industries still has weak management and disclosures of water-related risks and opportunities. To obtain concrete information about corporate water strategies and practices, an explorative analysis was conducted on 20 Dutch multinational companies. The article highlights various innovative practices. In sum, it is demonstrated that companies are expected to bear responsibility for their impact on water resources, in particular when it influences public access to water in areas with freshwater scarcity and/or weak government. Notwithstanding the critical conclusions of the CERES report, it is interesting to see an evolution in corporate research concerning sustainable water use and the development of greener products and greener ways of production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings suggest that SRI indices underperform conventional indices, and that the S\&P 500 has a significant impact on their behaviour. The CBOE's Volatility Index (VIX), the US Equity Related Economic Uncertainty Index (EEUi) and the impact of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPUi) are used to consider market volatility and political uncertainty , with VIX emerging as the best indicator to capture market uncertainty. The study signals a positive and significant impact on SRI indices during the first hundred days of the Obama administration with a lack of significant findings for the Trump administration for the period of study.

Corporate Social Performance (CSP) scores are price sensitive information that is subject to considerable estimation risk. Therefore, uncertainty in the input parameters is greater for SRI portfolios than conventional portfolios, and this affects the selection of the appropriate optimization method. We form SRI portfolios based on six different approaches and compare their performance along the dimensions of risk, risk-return trade-off, diversification and stability. Our results for SRI portfolios contradict those of the conventional portfolio optimization literature. We find that the more "formal" optimization approaches (Black-Litterman, Markowitz and robust estimation) lead to SRI portfolios that are both less risky and have superior risk-return trade-offs than do more simplistic approaches; although they also have more unstable asset allocations and lower diversification. Our conclusions are robust to a series of tests, including the use of different estimation windows and stricter screening criteria.},

The first section of the paper discusses contemporary trends in Europe and in certain European countries, whilst the second compares SR environmental investments and environmental factors in selected European countries from a multidimensional perspective. The aim of the study was to identify and evaluate these trends as well as to find similarities and differences between European countries, and subsequently to indicate groups of countries with similar approaches to pro-ecological investments. In order to solve the problem, descriptive and multidimensional statistical methods were used, namely correspondence analysis (CA). Although the research results clearly revealed upward tendencies in the volume of SR environmental investments in the analyzed period, they nonetheless represent a relatively low share in the total number of socially responsible investments. The overall growth in SRIs in Europe may have resulted from the more intense activities of policymakers in some countries as a consequence of concluding agreements reached during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in 2015. The results of the study also revealed no significant correlations between SR environmental investments and environmental variables among the European countries analyzed; hence, there is no substantial evidence that investors’ assets contribute to the improvement of the environment.},

My advice to those who are just starting out is to first read through the papers and books at the references and then come back here to check the application of the algorithm and the general computational structure (input/output) of the package. Also, be aware that this package is a direct translation of an existing Matlab package. It is available at: Broadly speaking there are no big differences in both packages but, the Matlab one has a couple of extra functionalities that are not available in the R package (e.g. choice of method for standard error calculation, use of C++ version of Hamilton's filter). The Mean Equation This particular R package is quite flexible when it comes to the specification of markov switching models. The central point of this flexibility resides in the input argument S, which controls for where to include markov switching effect. For instance, if you have 2 explanatory variables (1t x , 2t x) and if the input argument S, which is passed to the fitting function MS\_Regress\_Fit.R, is defined as S{\textless}-c(1,1), then the model for the mean equation is: 1 1 2 2 t t t S S S t t t t y x x β β σ ε = + + t S -represent the state at time t, that is, 1.... t S K = , where K is the number of states t S σ -model's standard deviation at state t S t S i β -beta coefficient for explanatory variable i at state t S where i goes from 1 to n t ε -residue which follows a particular distribution (in this case Normal or Student), with zero mean and std=var=1},

In these unconventional systems, many intrinsic features might come into play, including the fractal dimension and the fractal geometry. Despite abundant theoretical studies, experiments in fractal networks remain elusive. Here we experimentally investigate quantum transport in fractal networks by performing continuous-time quantum walks in fractal photonic lattices. We unveil the transport properties through the photon evolution patterns, the mean square displacement and the Pólya number. Contrarily to classical fractals, we observe anomalous transport governed solely by the fractal dimension. In addition, the critical point at which there is a transition from normal to anomalous transport depends on the fractal geometry. Our experiment allows the verification of physical laws in a quantitative manner and reveals the transport dynamics in great detail, thus opening a path to the understanding of more complex quantum phenomena governed by fractality. Quantum transport in fractal networks is experimentally investigated by performing continuous-time quantum walks in fractal photonic lattices. Contrarily to classical fractals, anomalous transport governed solely by the fractal dimension is observed.},

We performed this by using asymmetric log-likelihood functions (LLF) and variance models. From 2 January 2004 to 19 March 2021, we simulated 36 institutional investor\&rsquo;s portfolios. These used homogenous (either symmetric or asymmetric) Gaussian, Student\&rsquo;s t-distribution, or generalized error distribution (GED) and (symmetric or asymmetric) GARCH variance models. By including the impact of stock trading fees and taxes, we found that an institutional investor could outperform the S\&amp;P 500 stock index (SP500) if they used the suggested trading algorithm with symmetric homogeneous GED LLF and an asymmetric E-GARCH variance model. The trading algorithm had a simple rule, that is, to invest in the SP500 if the forecast probability of being in a calm or normal regime at t + 1 is higher than 50\%. With this configuration in the MS-GARCH model, the simulated portfolios achieved a 324.43\% accumulated return, of which the algorithm generated 168.48\%. Our results contribute to the discussion on using MS-GARCH models in algorithmic trading with a combination of either symmetric or asymmetric pdfs and variance models.},

	abstract = {Generation error is one of the shortcomings of the classical mean-variance portfolio selection model which would result in unstable performance in out-of-sample data sets. Machine learning provides several potential solutions for reducing the generalization error, such as adding penalty terms and random sampling. Due to some significant advantages of machine learning algorithms, we implement Black- Litterman (BL for short) series portfolio models integrated with quantitative opinions generating from machine learning algorithms in this paper. And, the fundamental factors in the Fama-French model form the basis of quantitative opinions. Considering the non-linearity among fundamental factors, we construct high-order terms and cross terms of basic features by the approach of dimension-increasing transformation. A multi-period portfolio strategy is designed in our work for the timeliness of quantitative opinions, the experimental results reveal that the optimal BL model with investor opinion generating from Random Forest gained over 20\% average annual return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.25. By comparison, S\&P 500 index gained about 14.94\% annual return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.00, the 1/N strategy gained about 15.92\% annual return and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.99. Moreover, the BL series models are more diversified and robust, about 30\% to 60\% of assets are selected to construct the portfolio. Even when the transaction cost is taken into account, our proposed models still obtained higher cumulative returns than S\&P 500 if the transaction cost is lower than 30\%\%. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The purpose of the article was to confirm the hypothesis of the existing influence of the indexes of world stock exchanges on the indices of local stock exchanges. Time series of Standard \& Poor's Global Ratings, NIKKEI 225, FTSE, DAX, WIG and PFTS stock indices were used for the study for the period from 2010 to 2017. On the basis of the analysis of the parameters of descriptive statistics, the relationship between the indicated indices with different levels of narrowness was determined. Using the Sharpe model, the absolute risk of the PFTS index was determined as the sum of specific and systematic risks. To test the time series for stationary, the expanded Dickie-Fuller test and the Phillips-Perron test were used. It has been determined that the analysed time series are the rows characterized by non-stationary and random roaming series, while the S \& P index has the most powerful trend, and WIG and FTSE have weaker trends. The hypothesis was put forward about the fact that world exchanges form the conjuncture on local exchanges, in particular Ukrainian exchange, which is confirmed by the results of the Granger causality test, as well as by cointegration tests.},

We use the stocks that are consistently listed in the U.S. Dow Jones Islamic index for a sample period from 1996 to 2012. We also include two macroeconomic mimicking portfolios to capture the premiums of industrial production growth and inflation innovation, accommodating the economic regime shifts.Based on the information coefficients, we find the six-month momentum and the fractal measure as momentum factors; the enterprise yield (gross profit/TEV) and the book to market ratio as valuation factors; the gross profit to total assets, the return on capital, and the scaled total accruals as quality factors. We further construct active portfolios using the augmented Black Litterman (ABL) factor model to avoid the factor alignment problem, with the factor views predicted using Markov Switching VAR, MIDAS, and Bayesian Model Averaging. The out-of-sample performance of our portfolios can produce information ratios of 0.7-0.8 over the composite indices, and information ratios of 0.42-0.48 over the style indices, with the annualized alphas of 10-11\%. Even when we put the constrained tracking error of 1\% over the benchmark, our portfolios still produce information ratios of 0.9-1.2 before transaction costs, and 0.6-0.8 after transaction costs. We provide intuitive explanations for each premium changing over time, and suggest the promising strategy for Islamic equity investors to outperform the market.},

By using a rolling window approach, we compared ARIMA with the hybrid models to examine whether hybrid ARIMA-SGARCH and ARIMA-EGARCH can really reflect the specific time-series characteristics and have better predictive power than the simple ARIMA model. In order to assess the precision and quality of these models in forecasting, we compared their equity lines, their forecasting error metrics (MAE, MAPE, RMSE, MAPE), and their performance metrics (annualized return compounded, annualized standard deviation, maximum drawdown, information ratio, and adjusted information ratio). The main contribution of this research is to show that the hybrid models outperform ARIMA and the benchmark (Buy\&amp;Hold strategy on S\&amp;P500 index) over the long term.

	abstract = {The objective is to construct fund-of-funds (FoFs) that follow an absolute return strategy and meet the requirements imposed by the value-at-risk (VaR) market risk measure. We propose the VaR Black-Litterman model which accounts for the VaR and trading (diversification, buy-in threshold, liquidity, currency) requirements. The model takes the form of a probabilistic integer, non-convex optimization problem. We first derive a deterministic reformulation of the probabilistic problem, which, depending on the information on the probability distribution of the FoF return, is the equivalent, or a close approximation, of the original problem. We then show that the continuous relaxation of the reformulated problem is a second-order cone optimization problem for a wide range of probability distributions. Finally, we use a specialized nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm which implements the portfolio risk branching rule to construct the optimal FoF. The practical relevance of the model and solution method is shown by their use by a financial institution for the construction of several FoFs that are now traded worldwide. The computational study attests that the proposed algorithmic technique is very efficient, outperforming, in terms of both speed and robustness, three state-of-the-art alternative solution methods and solvers. © 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

Because it is well known that asset allocation dominates portfolio performances, this paper focuses on asset allocation strategies.

Moreover, we show that these uncertainty structures correspond to confidence regions associated with the statistical procedures employed to estimate the market parameters.

	isbn = {978-0-7506-8321-0},
	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the insights of the Black-Litterman model and provides step-by-step instructions for implementation of the complex model. It details the process of developing the inputs for the Black-Litterman model, which enables investors to combine their unique views regarding the performance of various assets with the market equilibrium for generation of a new vector of expected returns. The new combined return vector leads to intuitive, well-diversified portfolios. The two parameters of the Black-Litterman model that control the relative importance placed on the equilibrium returns versus the view returns, the scalar and the uncertainty in the views, are very difficult to specify. The Black-Litterman formula with hundred percent certainty in the views enables determination of the implied confidence in a view. Using this implied confidence framework, a new method for controlling the tilts and the final portfolio weights caused by the views is introduced. The method asserts that the magnitude of the tilts should be controlled by the user- specified confidence level based on an intuitive zero percent to hundred percent confidence level. Overall, the Black-Litterman model overcomes the most-often cited weaknesses of mean-variance optimization helping users to realize the benefits of the Markowitz paradigm. Likewise, the proposed new method for incorporating user-specified confidence levels should increase the intuitiveness and the usability of the Black-Litterman model. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The simplicity and the intuitive appeal of portfolio construction using modern portfolio theory have attracted significant attention both in academia and in practice. Yet, despite considerable effort it took many years until portfolio managers started using modern portfolio theory for managing real money. Unfortunately, in real world applications there are many problems associated with it, and portfolio optimization is still considered by many practitioners to be difficult to apply. Introducing a simple crosssectional momentum strategy, we show how we can combine this strategy with market equilibrium using the Black-Litterman model in the mean-variance framework to rebalance the portfolio on a monthly basis.

The Black-Litterman model has the potential to integrate diverse approaches, based on a Bayesian methodology that effectively updates currently held opinions with data to form new opinions. It concludes by stating that these models are potentially of considerable importance in the management of the investment process in modern financial institutions where both viewpoints are represented.

These conditions bound mean returns with measures of average absolute covariability between assets. The bounds clarify the relationship between linear asset pricing models and well-diversified efficient portfolios. We argue that the extreme weightings in sample efficient portfolios are due to the dominance of a single factor in equity returns. This makes it easy to diversify on subsets to reduce residual risk, while weighting the subsets to reduce factor risk simultaneously. The latter involves taking extreme positions. This behavior seems unlikely to be at- tributable to sampling error.},

	abstract = {Since publication in 1990, the Black-Litterman asset allocation model has gained wide application in many financial institutions. As developed in the original paper, the Black-Litterman model provides the flexibility to combine the market equilibrium with additional market views of the investor. In the Black-Litterman model, the user inputs any number of views or statements about the expected returns of arbitrary portfolios, and the model combines the views with equilibrium, producing both the set of expected returns of assets as well as the optimal portfolio weights. In contrast to the Black-Litterman model, in the traditional mean-variance approach the user inputs a complete set of expected returns1, and the portfolio optimizer generates the optimal portfolio weights. However, users of the standard portfolio optimizers often find that their specification of expected returns produces output portfolio weights which may not make sense (due to the complex mapping between expected returns and portfolio weights and the absence of a natural starting point for the expected return assumptions). In this article, we use examples to illustrate the difference between the traditional mean-variance optimization process and the Black-Litterman process. In so doing, we demonstrate how the Black-Litterman approach2 provides both a reference point for expected return assumptions as well as a systematic approach to deviating from this point to express one’s market views},

	abstract = {We propose a new way of constructing more robust technology portfolios to overcome the weaknesses of previous technology portfolios based either on the judgments of experts or on quantitative data such as patents. Instead of using historical data, the method of nonlinear forecasting enables us to forecast the future number of patent citations and accordingly, to use the forecast as a quantitative proxy for future returns and risks of technologies. Using the Black-Litterman portfolio model, we improve the accuracy of inputs by combining the future views of experts with the future returns and risks of technologies. As a consequence of this, the portfolio becomes strongly future-oriented. With our approach, corporate managers use both experts and data more effectively to build robust technology portfolios. In particular, our method is of great help for companies launching new businesses because the method avoids heavy dependency on internal experts with little knowledge about emerging technologies. A company entering the molecular amplification instrument market is exemplified herein.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the role of thermodynamics, and in particular, entropy, for the development of economics within the last 150 years. The use of entropy has not only led to a significant increase in economic knowledge, but also to the emergence of such scientific disciplines as econophysics, complexity economics and quantum economics. Nowadays, an interesting phenomenon can be observed; namely, that rapid progress in economics is being made outside the mainstream. The first significant achievement was the emergence of entropy economics in the early 1970s, which introduced the second law of thermodynamics to considerations regarding production processes. In this way, not only was ecological economics born but also an entropy-based econometric approach developed. This paper shows that non-extensive cross-entropy econometrics is a valuable complement to traditional econometrics as it explains phenomena based on power-law probability distribution and enables econometric model estimation for non-ergodic ill-behaved (troublesome) inverse problems. Furthermore, the entropy economics has accelerated the emergence of modern econophysics and complexity economics. These new directions of research have led to many interesting discoveries that usually contradict the claims of conventional economics. Econophysics has questioned the efficient market hypothesis, while complexity economics has shown that markets and economies function best near the edge of chaos. Quantum economics has already appeared on the horizon, which recognizes money as a fundamental measurement device in the economy. The development of these sciences may indicate the need to reformulate all mainstream economics from its foundations.},

	abstract = {This study attempts to examine the impact of Human Resource (HR) practices on employees' satisfaction and performance through mediating role of employees' engagement. The study collects data from 181 employees of three leading banks of Multan city (Pakistan) namely: Habib Bank, Faysal Bank, and Allied Bank. The findings of the present study reveal that training and empowerment of the workers contributes more in employees' work performance and their job satisfaction than that of rewards/incentives. However, rewards/incentives are significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) related with the employees' engagement in organizational activities. Overall, HR practices (training, rewards and empowerment) are significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) related with employees' engagement and confirm the assumptions of Baron and Kenny (1986) for mediation analysis. The results of the study are gleaned by using the direct path way and multiple regression to investigate the impact of HR practices on mediating variable (employees' engagement) and mediating variable on both dependent variables (employees' satisfaction and employees' performance). The results of the study confirm that proposed hypotheses are statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and indicate that employees' engagement partially mediates the relationship between HR practices and both employees' satisfaction and employees' performance outcomes.},

We searched studies related to construction industry in Taiwan, and no study have discussed how to improve job performance through the reduction of job stress and finding ways to relieve job stress. Therefore, we try to regard happiness as a variable that can relieve job stress and improve job performance, and discuss if construction industry companies are able to enhance employee’s performance by improving their happiness. Through the feedback of 252 respondents, we found that job stress can impact on the job performance of respondents if only the impact made by job stress is considered. If happiness is added as a variable, the negative impact of job stress on job performance will be reduced significantly. As a result, the strong relationship between happiness and the relief of job stress and the improvement of job performance is proven. The study also make recommendations based on the result.},

I study the effect on firm-level value, rather than employee-level productivity, to take into account the cost of increasing job satisfaction. To address reverse causality, I measure firm value by using future stock returns, controlling for risk, firm characteristics, industry performance, and outliers. Companies listed in the “100 Best Companies to Work For in America” generated 2.3\% to 3.8\% higher stock returns per year than their peers from 1984 through 2011. These results have three main implications. First, consistent with human resource management theories, job satisfaction is beneficial for firm value. Second, corporate social responsibility can improve stock returns. Third, the stock market does not fully value intangible assets, and so it may be necessary to shield managers from short-term stock prices to encourage long-run growth.},

We theorize that banks use employee treatment as a screen to assess firms’ trustworthiness, which encompasses not only confidence in firms’ ability to perform well but also the belief that they will act with good intent toward their creditors. We integrate screening theory and stakeholder theory to explain the—oftentimes unintended—consequences that firms’ actions toward employees have on their relationships with other stakeholders. An analysis of U.S. firms between 2003 and 2010 shows that favorable employee treatment reduces the cost of bank loans, and this relationship is stronger when banks cannot infer firms’ intent from their relations with stakeholders other than employees. A policy-capturing study provides further support that employee treatment serves as a screen for intent. We discuss the implications of our stakeholder-screening perspective as a novel way to understand the second-order, unintended effects of a focal stakeholder relationship on firms’ relations with other stakeholders.},

The result is especially noteworthy for studies regarding Taiwanese companies since quite a few of them are original equipment manufacturers (hereafter also referred to as OEMs), of intermediate goods.

This study adopted the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) to analyze the CSR spending—Market Stock Price relationship. The control variables included firm size, leverage and ownership. Based on the findings, no significant relationship exists between CSR spending and market stock price (MSP) in any direction. Added to this, control variables had no effect on MSP. However, the findings showed a significant positive effect of firm size on CSR spending and a negative effect of leverage on CSR spending, with no significant effect of ownership on the same. This study has several implications for the enhancement of the information and understanding of the firms’ Market Stock Price as it shed light on the CSR spending—Market Stock Price relationship.

We hypothesize that because shareholders factor improved productive efficiency into stock price, productivity mediates the relationship between corporate social and financial performance. Furthermore, we argue that key stakeholders’ social considerations are more valuable for firms with higher levels of discretionary cash and income stream uncertainty. Therefore, we hypothesize that those two contingencies moderate the mediated process of corporate social performance with financial performance. Our analysis, based on a comprehensive longitudinal dataset of the U.S. manufacturing firms from 1992 to 2009, lends strong support for these hypotheses. In short, this paper uncovers a productivity-based, context-dependent mechanism underlying the relationship between corporate social performance and financial performance.},

More specifically, the study contributes to a search for signals of HRM investments that the capital market either attends to or should attend to. It focuses on potential signals of high-performance work systems (HPWSs), constituting an HRM investment that has been at the center of research in strategic HRM. Based on signaling theory, a model is proposed of relationships among three signal characteristics (signal fit, signal erosion, and signal diffusion) and sustainable signal correlation.

Proponents argue that doing so will improve employees’ productivity and ultimately the firm's performance. However, critics argue that job satisfaction has only a modest relationship with an employee's job performance, and therefore, such an investment will likely have little impact on the firm's financial performance. To investigate the relationship between employees’ job satisfaction and firm performance, we collected a sample of 404 employees working in 31 firms. We tested this relationship using latent growth modeling which allows us to latently examine how employees’ job satisfaction at one time point can predict the trajectory of firm performance. Study results indicated that job satisfaction predicted a positive linear change in two financial indices of firm performance (i.e., return on assets and return on equity) over the course of four years when controlling for three indicators of firm size. These results suggest that the effects of job satisfaction on firm performance are not immediate but rather take time to manifest.},

The authors compare firm value of two groups of firms: the firms on the Fortune magazine’s list of “100 Best Companies to Work For” and matched firms that are not on the list. The authors employ difference-in-difference approaches in the tests. Findings The authors find that when the crisis happens, the best companies experience larger decreases in firm value than comparable firms. In addition, such decreases in firm value only exist among the best companies with high financial flexibility. The authors also show that job satisfaction alone does not create firm value during the financial crisis; only when interacted with high financial flexibility, employee satisfaction leads to high firm value. Finally, the authors document that best companies do not have any advantage in the recovery of firm value after the crisis, regardless of their level of financial flexibility. Research limitations/implications There is considerable debate on whether job satisfaction leads to performance or performance leads to satisfaction (Luthans, 1998). The authors show that the impact of employee satisfaction on firm value changes over time. The authors also identify a crucial factor that impacts the value-creation of employee satisfaction: financial flexibility. The findings suggest that the ambiguous results documented in prior literature can be due to the different sample periods and the failure to identify the impact of financial flexibility in previous studies. Practical implications The findings provide helpful implications to the business community. The evidence suggests that to reap the benefits of employee satisfaction, companies need to manage their financial flexibility to buffer against potential negative shocks while having strong corporate governance mechanism to mitigate agency concerns. Moreover, the study provides an investment recommendation to socially responsible investment (SRI) and suggests that it is better off implementing dynamic SRI investment strategies according to economic condition. Social implications The evidence suggests that the economic value of employee satisfaction is related to firms’ financial flexibility and economic conditions. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature by showing that the impact of employee satisfaction on firm value changes over time. The test design not only allows the authors to study the effect of employee satisfaction on firm value at a particular point in time, but also helps the authors examine the variation in the effect over economic cycles. This paper also contributes to the literature on SRI. The authors identify a crucial factor that impacts the value-creation of employee satisfaction: financial flexibility.},

	abstract = {Purpose Ascription theory together with human capital theory both predict that, over time, the scarcity of knowledge and skills in increasingly complex working contexts will “crowd out” the influence of arbitrary characteristics such as gender. The purpose of this paper is to test the extent to which job performance determinants of research productivity differ by gender in their contributions to research productivity, in the developing country (South Africa) context, in which gender and other forms of historical discrimination were previously endemic. Design/methodology/approach Research output was measured as published journal articles indexed by Thomson Reuters Institute for Scientific Information, ProQuest’s International Bibliography of the Social Sciences and the South African Department of Higher Education and Training, as well as conference proceedings publications, conference papers presented and published books and book chapters. Structural equation modelling, with critical ratio and χ2 tests of path moderation were used to test theory predicting gender (sex) differences moderate the potential influence of certain intrinsic determinants of job performance on research productivity, as a form of academic job performance. Findings Gender is found to moderate the relationship between experience and research productivity, with this relationship stronger for men, who are also found to have higher research output. This is considered a paradox of sorts, as English and African home languages, which proxy racial differences in societal and economic disadvantages and unequal opportunities, are not significantly associated with research output differences. Findings further suggest none of the tested intrinsic effects are moderated by gender, contesting theory from general work contexts. Research limitations/implications This research applied a cross-sectional design, and did not apply causal methods, instrumental variables or controls for endogeneity. Nevertheless, these are limitations shared with most research in the human resources field, which is constrained by the type of data available in organisational contexts. Further research might do well to investigate non-intrinsic influences on research productivity which may be vulnerable to differences in societal gender roles. Originality/value This research offers a novel perspective of research productivity and gender inequality in a developing country context of increasing diversity, which might offer useful insights into other contexts facing increasing diversity in higher education. The problem of gender-based inequality in research productivity is empirically identified, and little evidence is found to support the notion that intrinsic effects, including core self-evaluations, are at the heart of this problem. Arguably, these findings reduce the problem space around gender inequality in research productivity, in a context in which other forms of disadvantage might no longer manifest in research productivity inequality.},

	abstract = {Research summary: In this paper, we theorize and empirically investigate how a long-term orientation impacts firm value. To study this relationship, we exploit exogenous changes in executives' long-term incentives. Specifically, we examine shareholder proposals on long-term executive compensation that pass or fail by a small margin of votes. The passage of such “close call” proposals is akin to a random assignment of long-term incentives and hence provides a clean causal estimate. We find that the adoption of such proposals leads to (1) an increase in firm value and operating performance—suggesting that a long-term orientation is beneficial to companies—and (2) an increase in firms' investments in long-term strategies such as innovation and stakeholder relationships. Overall, our results are consistent with a “time-based” agency conflict between shareholders and managers. Managerial summary: This paper shows that corporate short-termism is hampering business success. We show clear, causal evidence that imposing long-term incentives on executives—in the form of long-term executive compensation—improves business performance. Long-term executive compensation includes restricted stocks, restricted stock options, and long-term incentive plans. Firms that adopted shareholder resolutions on long-term compensation experienced a significant increase in their stock price. This stock price increase foreshadowed an increase in operating profits that materialized after two years. We unpack the reasons for these improvements in performance, and find that firms that adopted these shareholder resolutions made more investments in R\&D and stakeholder engagement, especially pertaining to employees and the natural environment.

Education and social intervention workers (N = 1300, K = 80) from Chile, Spain and Uruguay participate; a subsample of educators (k = 1, n = 37) from the south central Chile and from Chile, Uruguay and Spain (n = 1149); workers from organizations in Latin America and Southern Europe, military cadets from Argentina (N {\textless} 1000); and teams (K = 14) from Spanish companies.ResultsIndividual and collective well-being indicators were related, suggesting that the emotional climate as a context improves personal well-being. Individual factors (emotional creativity and openness and universalism values), psychosocial factors (low stress, control over work and social support supervisors and peers) were positively associated with personal well-being in education and social intervention context. Organizational dynamic or transformational culture is directly and indirectly associated with individual well-being through previously described psychosocial factors. Group processes such as internal communication and safe participation, task orientation or climate of excellence as well as leadership style that reinforces participation and belonging, were positively associated with collective well-being in labor and military context and predict team work socio-emotional climate in a longitudinal study- but were unrelated to individual well-being. Transformational leadership plays a mediating role between functional factors and social-emotional climate in work teams. Organizational role autonomy, functional organizational leadership, integration and resources were associated with collective well-being in organizations. Organizational leadership moderates the relationship between task orientation and collective well-being in military context.ConclusionIndividual and microsocial factors influence personal well-being. Meso level factors favorable to well-being through processes which reinforce social belonging, influence directly collective well-being and indirectly personal well-being. Leadership that reinforces participation and belonging play a central role for emotional climate. Stress and emotional climate playing an important pivotal role for psychological well-being.},

The importance of the satisfaction of intrinsic and extrinsic needs and motivations was examined to advance in the development of a positive organizational psychology, which investigates the factors that reinforce well-being. Seventy-five executives from large and medium-sized companies were surveyed and 8 in-depth interviews were carried out. The main predictors of well-being are, from family satisfaction, the family’s ability to cope with stress and, from work satisfaction, extrinsic aspects such as material conditions of the job and stability, and intrinsic aspects such as recognition and the ability to organize one’s own work. The more general regression model shows that extrinsic job and family satisfaction predict general well-being, not intrinsic satisfaction. The results are discussed in the framework of classical models of motivation, such as Herzberg’s, their relationship to Deci and Ryan’s self-determination theory, and the current study of well-being in organizations.},

At the same time, satisfied and physically and mentally healthy employees increase EE, both EE and WB thus being fundamental to individual and organizational performance. This paper aims to evaluate the relationships between EE and WB and between the dimensions of these two complex constructs. These relationships were assessed based on data obtained from a sample of 269 employees in Romania, using as a method a mix of analyses based on structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network analysis (ANN). The results highlighted a positive two-way relationship between EE and WB. Among the dimensions of EE, motivation and work environment are those that ensure a more pronounced perception of WB by the employee. Emotional WB, occupational WB, and social WB are the dimensions of WB with a significant influence on the general level of EE.},

However, extant research does not provide any compelling conclusion regarding the possibility of such tradeoff effects since researchers have usually focused on single well-being dimensions while using diverse research designs (e.g. samples from different countries, different conceptualizations and measures of HPWPs and employee well-being). Diversely, this paper explores the relationship between employees’ perception of HPWPs and three well-being dimensions (health, happiness, and relational well-being) using a probabilistic sample (n = 1,364 employees), from a single country (i.e. Germany), and a set of uniform measures of HPWPs and employee well-being. The findings show that some HPWPs indeed present tradeoff effects on different dimensions of employee well-being. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to adopt an analytic view on the relationships between HPWPs and employee well-being.},

Current trends of management are beginning to consider the principles or philosophy of “Happiness Management” as future trends that can be applied to any organization, regardless of the sector where they operate. That is the reason why nowadays, it is necessary to implement cultures willing to get competitive and sustainable results in the company, thereby renewing in the ﬁrst place corporate welfare and, consequently, its labor productivity, and secondly improving organizational performance generating competitiveness. Finally, the culture of innovation based on increasing corporate welfare improves the image of the company, being it projected in a positive way towards all its stakeholders.},

	abstract = {This paper propagates that organizational performance should be evaluated through more relevant measures other than conventional financial and non-financial measures. The past study stressed that the practical organizational performance evaluation system should ensure the balance of financial and nonfinancial performance measures. In addition, organizational performance measures need to be chosen according to the context of the organization as they may have different outcomes in terms of performance. The appropriate selection of organizational performance measures is seen as a crucial factor in effectively accomplishing organizational strategic objectives. Therefore, this paper introduces the futuristic organizational performance measurement through happiness perspectives covering employees’ happiness, customers’ happiness and shareholders’ happiness. Non-financial performance could be measured through employee and customer happiness, whereas financial performance can be measured through shareholder happiness. Future research could confirm and enhance further the findings and contribution of organizational performance from happiness perspectives.},

	abstract = {We examine whether employee welfare practices are associated with future stock price crash risk. Two competing hypotheses were tested: the stakeholder theory hypothesis \& the agency theory hypothesis. According to the stakeholder hypothesis, if strong commitment to employee well-being genuinely aims at strengthening the firm's reputation in the market, enhancing the shareholders' engagement, avoiding costly strikes, and boosting the employees' productivity, higher level of employee welfare would be expected to mitigate stock crash risks. On the contrary, the agency theory predicts that, if managers attempt to use generous employee welfare plans to reduce the likelihood that the employees blow the whistle on the management wrongdoings, better employee welfare would likely be associated with higher crash risk. We find robust evidence supporting the agency theory thesis: high levels of employee welfare standards contribute to stock price crash risk. This finding is consistent with the view that employee welfare plans form a powerful strategy that can help managers in their bad-news-hoarding activities (withholding bad news from investors). Moreover, earnings management and the likelihood of whistleblowing appear to be the channels through which employee welfare impacts stock price crash risk. Our evidence further shows that the positive relation between employee welfare and crash risk is stronger for labor intensive firms and industries, in more regulated labor markets, and in less competitive product markets. Furthermore, this positive relationship is more pronounced in poorly governed firms and in countries with poor investors' protection and lower disclosure requirements.},

	abstract = {This study investigates whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) mitigates or contributes to stock price crash risk. Crash risk, defined as the conditional skewness of return distribution, captures asymmetry in risk and is important for investment decisions and risk management. If socially responsible firms commit to a high standard of transparency and engage in less bad news hoarding, they would have lower crash risk. However, if managers engage in CSR to cover up bad news and divert shareholder scrutiny, CSR would be associated with higher crash risk. Our findings support the mitigating effect of CSR on crash risk. We find that firms’ CSR performance is negatively associated with future crash risk after controlling for other predictors of crash risk. The result holds after we account for potential endogeneity. Moreover, the mitigating effect of CSR on crash risk is more pronounced when firms have less effective corporate governance or a lower level of institutional ownership. The results are consistent with the notion that firms that actively engage in CSR also refrain from bad news hoarding behavior, thus reducing crash risk. This role of CSR is particularly important when governance mechanisms, such as monitoring by boards or institutional investors, are weak.},

In the case of Vietnam, its implementation will be influenced by several factors, including ethical leadership. Drawing upon the stakeholder theory, this study develops and tests a serial mediation model to explain how CSR and firm reputation can connect ethical leadership to enhanced firm performance. The PLS-SEM results from survey data collected from 653 mid- and top-level managers from large companies in Vietnam indicate that ethical leadership positively influences CSR, which, in turn, results in enhanced firm reputation and firm performance. This study contributes to research on the intersection between CSR and leadership in the context of emerging markets. This study also provides some managerial implications for Vietnamese firms striving to promote ethical leadership to achieve CSR outcomes.},

Using data from 109 managers employed by a large (over 5000 employees) customer services organization on the West Coast of the United States, both job satisfaction (r = .36, p {\textless}.01, 95\% CI = .18 to .52) and psychological well-being (PWB; r = .43, p {\textless} .01, 95\% CI = .26 to .58) were associated with supervisory performance ratings. Using Fredrickson's (2001) broaden-and-build model as the theoretical base, the authors found that PWB moderates the relation between job satisfaction and job performance. Consistent with Fredrickson's model, performance was highest when employees reported high scores on both PWB and job satisfaction. This moderating effect of PWB may account for some of the inconsistent results of previous studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Social responsibility (SR) is a concept or practice by which organizations take into account the interest of society by taking responsibility for the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. The SR of organizations implies ethical behavior concerning all stakeholders and a company’s commitment to the sustainable economic development of society. Organizational ethics is a set of written and unwritten codes of principles and values that govern decisions and actions within an organization. Ethics has a rather internal perspective, while social responsibility has a rather external perspective. This study examines the impact of social responsibility and organizational ethics on employees’ wellbeing. To perform the empirical analysis, we conducted a survey among 423 employees from Romanian organizations. Using the structural equation modeling, we analyzed the relationships between social responsibility, organizational ethics, and employees’ wellbeing, emphasizing the positive impact of ethical and responsible behavior of the organization on the employees’ wellbeing. The organization’s employees play a dual role: firstly, they are all internal stakeholders, and secondly, they are constituents of an external stakeholder essential for the organization—the community. The results show a significant positive influence of social responsibility and organizational ethics on employees’ wellbeing as a result of a responsible and ethical behavior in relation to the organizational stakeholders.},

The concept of happiness has been receiving more attention over the past decade as research suggests that it may be a source of greater performance. Design/methodology/approach This research uses a questionnaire survey and conditional process analysis among Japanese managers and front-line workers within Japanese firms in Japan. Findings This paper found that positive subjective well-being partially mediates the relationship between general organizational virtuousness and self-management-related job performance, while it acts as a moderator in the relationship between general organizational virtuousness and leadership-related job performance. Practical implications These findings indicate that in the Japanese context, the firm’s investment in organizational virtuousness will increase one part of job performance, but that investment may not be sufficient in itself to positively affect leadership competency, unless it also pays attention to its employees’ positive subjective well-being. Originality/value Based on this growing realization of the importance of subjective well-being, or happiness, and the lack of academic research in Japan on its impact on organization, this paper investigates its effect on employees’ ability to manage their own tasks and lead others.},

In this paper, we investigate the contemporaneous and the lead-lag relationship between local daily happiness sentiment extracted from Twitter and stock returns of cross-listed companies, i.e., the Chinese companies listed in the United States. The empirical results show that: 1) by respectively controlling for the firm capitalization, liquidity and volatility, there exists the largest skewness on the Most-happiness subgroup. (2) There exist bi-directional relationships between daily happiness sentiment and market variables, i.e., the stock return, range-based volatility and excess trading volume. (3) There are significantly positive stock returns, higher excess trading volume and higher range-based volatility around the daily happiness sentiment spike days. These findings not only suggest that there exists significant interdependence between online activities and stock market dynamics, but also provide evidence for the existence of “home bias”.},

Several points of view are being researched: positive, negative and no correlation between the happiness of the employee and the performance of the company. Moreover, other factors that might have an impact of both variables were taken into account. The findings showed that the topic is very complex and there was no direct correlation found between the variable, however, it was inevitable that there is a link between them, as some studies even assumed a possibility of indirect correlation. In addition, it was concluded that further and deeper research is required.},

Therefore, this work’s main objective is to design a structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the main critical dimensions of brand orientation to influence happiness in responsible and sustainable entities. For this purpose, a descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out based on primary data from a survey of a representative sample of 216 managers of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Andalusia (Spain) in the construction, industry and services sectors. The model results reveal significant dimensions of brand orientation and positively direct influence on happiness management. One of the significant managerial implications of this work is that the model allows for more responsible and sustainable management of entities by considering brand orientation about happiness.},

The study engages the stimulus–organism–response model for testing the association between CSR and well-being of employees that leads to employee green behavior. Furthermore, social exchange theory has been utilized to describe the association between well-being and green behavior of employees. Data have been gathered through questionnaire from 509 employees working in guest-service hotels of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling has been used to test the hypotheses. Findings show that CSR, environmental concern, and knowledge have positive effect on employee well-being, whereas environmental awareness has positive but insignificant effect on employee well-being. Furthermore, environmental concern, knowledge, and well-being have a positive influence on green behavior, whereas CSR and environmental knowledge have a positive but insignificant effect. Moreover, well-being fully mediates the relationship between CSR and green behavior and between environmental awareness and green behavior of employees. However, a partial mediation was observed between environmental concern and green behavior. The findings also indicate that no mediation was found between environmental knowledge and employee green behavior. The findings suggest that the hotel managers should invest to improve employee's awareness regarding green behavior by conducting environmental training for cultivating environmental knowledge and awareness. Moreover, CSR activities should be performed for attaining competitive edge and maintaining a balance between progress and sustainability of environment.},

	abstract = {Eating Disorders (ED) and obesity are a pandemic in developed and developing societies. In 2018, Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumption reported data on obesity (15\%) and ED (12\%). Spain thus ranks fifth among European countries in childhood obesity, with the highest incidence in the 6–12-year-age group. Many studies point to media as one of the contributing elements to this growth. In this sense, it should be noted that Spanish children are exposed to an average of 9000 television commercials per year and the vast majority of these are for food and beverage products of little or no nutritional value. Educommunication becomes essential here, since media have the capacity to educate, prevent and influence the behaviour as part of their social marketing strategies and within the happiness management philosophy. The aim of this paper is to analyse food and beverage advertising on mobile devices aimed at children. The methodology used includes a content analysis, a survey, and focus groups. The results show that many of the food products are bought or ordered as a direct result of advertising. The main conclusions point to the need to regulate the messages transmitted in order to guide the social function of media so that public health and happiness can be improved.},

The purpose of this research is to examine the antecedents of social media advertising value and their consequences for attitudes to healthy food and intentions to consume it, in a representative sample of Spanish consumers. The theory of Ducoffe’s advertising value model was used as a conceptual framework for the antecedents of attitudes based on utilitarian and hedonic values. To achieve this objective, a descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out based on primary data from a survey of a representative sample of the Spanish population with 2023 valid questionnaires. The Partial Least Square (PLS) method was applied to test the hypothesized relationships and predictive variables. The result of this research allows us to determine which variables influence the consumer’s response, as measured by intention, motivated by the consumer’s attitude to the value of healthy food, as influenced by the advertising value on social networks. Furthermore, the findings show that, for advertising healthy food on social networks to be valuable, it must be credible and richly informative.},

	abstract = {Supply chains are intended to become the essential part of this global competitive world as organizations are seeking to formulate strategized advantages. To put it differently, most of the companies are aiming to adopt new businesses and raise the competition in the global market. For this, most of the companies or organizations are choosing strategies such as corporate social responsibility and supply chain management that allow the companies to ensure financial strengthening. Moreover, stakeholders and customers have raised their concerns towards corporate social responsibility with respect to global supply chain and ensured to act in a socially responsible way. It is believed that majority of the organizations are placing high importance on implementing corporate social responsibility or CSR activities in order to enhance the whole business. The active participation of companies in CSR activities will always benefit them in terms of profit, virtues and other moral standards. Usually, corporate firms exhibit their virtues ignoring the moral standard, which eventually reveals the nature of hypocrisy. Corporate hypocrisy is a context when companies or organizations assure the public to do something in corporate social responsibility context and end up doing entirely different. Keeping this in mind, the current study aims to reveal the hidden nature of corporate hypocrisy and its effect on inner stakeholders explicitly focusing on the employees' observations on corporate hypocrisy; examine the hypocritical behaviour of the reputed firms towards the consumers, which in turn affects the supply chain globally. For this, data analysis will be carried out with consumer firms across countries. Results show that firms are completely held responsible for their behaviour eventually defaming reputation.},

The results indicated consumer-brand identification was impacted to a greater extent by two social capital factors: (1) social interaction ties and (2) shared vision, than by brand prestige and brand distinctiveness. Both social interaction ties and consumer-brand identification were also predictive of future behavioral loyalty and purchase frequency. Further, our moderation analysis revealed the impact of consumer-brand identification on behavioral loyalty was contingent on consumer happiness. The proposed framework and results reinforce the importance of consumer-to-consumer social capital and consumer happiness and add new insights into the dynamics of consumer-brand identification, consumer happiness, and enduring consumer loyalty.},

Investigating the components of e-loyalty may be a way to improve it. Using a Spanish sample, this study investigates a nine-dimension, latent variable model to understand the relationship between electronic service quality (e-SQ) and e-satisfaction, as well as that between e-satisfaction and e-loyalty within Spanish fashion brand e-retailers. Results suggest that for fashion e-retailers in Spain, e-service quality is positively related to e-satisfaction and e-satisfaction is positively related to e-loyalty. This work supports the use of this framework in future research to better understand these relationships in other countries.},

Among 2494 Spaniards individuals of both sexes, we found that these individuals valued political situation, economic situation and socio-demographic characteristics to have a strong association in that order, with happiness and that this last construct is a fundamental factor to life satisfaction. The importance of perception is validated using a structural equation model that evaluates relationships and validity on the constructs in question. Collinearity statistics, average variance extracted, and an estimated partial least square regression model are evaluated to confirm independent meaning, correct construct measure and endogenous variable explanation by the predictive constructs. Results indicate that the level of happiness in Spaniards is most influenced by political perception. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, and it is proposed to continue this study in a non-developed country.},

Using Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores to assess a firm's ESG transparency, we look at a sample of 1996 large cap companies across 47 developed and emerging countries and territories. Our empirical analyses suggest that the benefits from ESG disclosure outweigh their costs for the average listed firm. We find supporting evidence for greater disclosure of ESG issues boosting firm valuation measures, such as Tobin's Q. Furthermore, our results suggest that firms with greater asset size, better liquidity, higher R\&D intensity, fewer insider holdings and good past financial performance will be more transparent in ESG issues.},

To help resolve longstanding theoretical, empirical, and substantive debates, we present an integrative conceptual framework based on the overarching concepts of unique resource portfolios, team decision-processes, and role incongruence perceptions. We test predictions from this framework using meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 146 primary studies conducted in 33 different countries. We find that female representation in the upper echelons in general is positively and weakly related to forms of long-term financial performance, but negatively and weakly related to short-term stock market returns. We observe that reduced strategic risk-taking is a mediating mechanism that explains why financial performance is improved. We also show that financial performance improvements are accentuated in environmental and organizational contexts that provide greater decision latitude to executives. Finally, we discuss and provide preliminary tests for extending these effects to other stakeholders (corporate social performance) and different time intervals for performance.},

Using panel data probit regression, and after controlling for country-level governance and institutional factors, the study finds that embedding environmental targets in corporate strategy does encourage corporate managers to design and develop eco-friendly products and services, and such firm-level commitments at the top motivates managers to promote, market, and label environmentally friendly products.

Much of the rhetoric surrounding gender diversity centres on whether diversity has a financial impact. In this paper we take an aggregate (market-level) approach and compare the performance of portfolios of firms with gender diverse boards to those without. We also investigate whether having multiple women on the board is linked to performance, and if there is a within-industry effect. Overall, we do not find evidence of an association between diversity and performance. We find some weak evidence of a negative correlation between having multiple women on the board and performance, but that in some industries diversity is positively correlated with performance.},

But what happens when women do achieve leadership roles? And what sorts of positions are they given? This paper argues that while women are now achieving more high profile positions, they are more likely than men to find themselves on a ‘glass cliff’, such that their positions are risky or precarious. This hypothesis was investigated in an archival study examining the performance of FTSE 100 companies before and after the appointment of a male or female board member. The study revealed that during a period of overall stock-market decline those companies who appointed women to their boards were more likely to have experienced consistently bad performance in the preceding five months than those who appointed men. These results expose an additional, largely invisible, hurdle that women need to overcome in the workplace. Implications for the evaluation of women leaders are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.},

These results suggest that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. Accordingly, we find that chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards. However, the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with fewer takeover defenses.

	abstract = {Generation error is one of the shortcomings of the classical mean-variance portfolio selection model which would result in unstable performance in out-of-sample data sets. Machine learning provides several potential solutions for reducing the generalization error, such as adding penalty terms and random sampling. Due to some significant advantages of machine learning algorithms, we implement Black-Litterman (BL for short) series portfolio models integrated with quantitative opinions generating from machine learning algorithms in this paper. And, the fundamental factors in the Fama-French model form the basis of quantitative opinions. Considering the non-linearity among fundamental factors, we construct high-order terms and cross terms of basic features by the approach of dimension-increasing transformation. A multi-period portfolio strategy is designed in our work for the timeliness of quantitative opinions, the experimental results reveal that the optimal BL model with investor opinion generating from Random Forest gained over 20\% average annual return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.25. By comparison, S\&P 500 index gained about 14.94\% annual return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.00, the 1/N strategy gained about 15.92\% annual return and the Sharpe Ratio of 0.99. Moreover, the BL series models are more diversified and robust, about 30\% to 60\% of assets are selected to construct the portfolio. Even when the transaction cost is taken into account, our proposed models still obtained higher cumulative returns than S\&P 500 if the transaction cost is lower than 30\%\%.},

Regimes changes present a big challenge to traditional asset allocation, demanding a more adaptive approach. The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for dynamic asset allocation modeling in the presence of regime switching. This research builds on previous works to develop a combined regime-switching and Black-Litterman for optimal asset allocation in Iran asset classes considering data during 212 months, ranging from March 1999 to September 2016. The results show the existence of different financial regimes that lead to variable optimal asset allocations across different regimes. Finally, it is suggested that the combination of regime-switching and Black-Litterman model for mixture of stock and 1-year banking deposit investment gives significantly better results than other models in terms of performance and a modified sharp ratio.},

From an analytical point of view, all the results are examined through an application of the approach of Black and Litterman (1992). In particular, our innovative contribution to the extant literature is the use of the EGARCH-M (exponential GARCH-in-mean) model to formulate a volatility forecast of returns used as an input for determining some subjective views to be included in the Black-Litterman model. The bets of the portfolio manager thus enter into the mechanism of generating expectations about the vector of returns, revealing information about investment opportunities. The results show that the Black-Litterman (BL) model using the EGARCH inputs produces allocations with potentially sizeable benefits. Greater reliance on the implied BL excess returns, in setting the allocations, result in higher risk-return ratio. © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

The focus of this paper is on the two most popular of these frameworks—the Black-Litterman model and the Bayes approach. We will prove that—from the point of traditional portfolio optimization—the Black-Litterman is just a special case of the Bayes approach.

Extension of the Black-Litterman Bayesian approach to portfolio construction in the presence of non-trivial preferences about higher moments of asset return distributions has a particular application to active style allocation decisions in hedge fund investing. Results here suggest that the systematic implementation of active style allocation decisions can add significant value in a hedge fund portfolio, provided implementation of a sound investment process to account for non-normality and parameter uncertainty in hedge fund return distributions.

Portfolio optimization presents a challenge to investors through the tendency of small differences in expected return inputs to create major swings in portfolio weightings, sometimes leading to extreme portfolio allocations. The authors believe that the Black–Litterman (BL) model can play a highly constructive role in alleviating this problem for investors, because the model combines active investment views and equilibrium views through a Bayesian approach. So that investors can fully exploit this important investment model, the authors discuss the development of the BL model within the mean-variance portfolio efficiency paradigm, examine the phenomenon of unintentional trades and additional risks related to the traditional implementation of BL in active portfolio management, and propose a potential remedy that leads to portable alpha implementation of active portfolios.

	abstract = {Note: This paper introduces version 1 of ctsem, now split into the sub package ctse-mOMX, for mixed effects maximum likelihood based inference of linear continuous time dynamic systems, using OpenMx in the background. For discussion of the newer Stan based implementation, allowing for full random effects, Bayesian and frequentist estimation , and nonlinearities, see RedHierarchical Bayesian Continuous Time Dynamic Modelling for the conceptual overview and RedIntroduction to Hierarchical Continuous Time Dynamic Modelling With ctsem for the software details. Discussion within this current paper may still be helpful in either case. We introduce ctsemOMX (BlueDriver, Oud, and Voelkle Blue2017), an R package for continuous time structural equation modelling of panel (N {\textgreater} 1) and time series (N = 1) data using full information maximum likelihood. Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the difficulty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of effects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic differential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the flexible specification of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between effects are estimated simultaneously by modelling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with different shapes, group differences, higher order diffusion effects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We first introduce and define continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.},

The model allows the short rate to exhibit both mean reversion and conditional heteroskedasticity and nests the popular generalized autoregressive conditional hetero-skedasticity (GARCH) and square root process specifications. The conditional variance process accommodates volatility clustering and dependence on the level of the interest rate. A first-order Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities governs the switching between regimes. The GRS model is compared with various existing models of the short rate in terms of (1) the statistical fit of short-term interest rate data and (2) out-of-sample forecasting performance.},

Idiosyncratic volatility is increasing over time with some literature attributing this to the IT revolution. An understanding of the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and return is indeed relevant for idiosyncratic risk pricing and asset allocation, in a context of emerging technologies. The case of high-tech exchange traded funds (ETFs) is especially interesting, since ETFs introduce new noise to the market due to arbitrage activities and high frequency trading. This article examines the relevance of idiosyncratic risk in explaining the return of nine high-tech ETFs. The Markov regime-switching (MRS) methodology for heteroscedastic regimes has been applied. We found that high-tech ETF returns are negatively related to idiosyncratic risk during the high volatility regime and positively related to idiosyncratic risk during the low volatility regime. These results suggest that idiosyncratic volatility matters in high-tech ETF pricing, and that the effects are driven by volatility regimes, leading to changes across them.},

	abstract = {In mathematical statistics, the Fisher information (sometimes simply called information [1]) is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observ-able random variable X carries about an unknown pa-rameter θ of a distribution that models X. Formally, it is the variance of the score, or the expected value of the observed information. In Bayesian statistics, the asymptotic distribution of the posterior mode depends on the Fisher information and not on the prior (according to the Bernstein–von Mises theorem, which was antic-ipated by Laplace for exponential families). [2] The role of the Fisher information in the asymptotic theory of maximum-likelihood estimation was emphasized by the statistician Ronald Fisher (following some initial results by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth). The Fisher information is also used in the calculation of the Jeffreys prior, which is used in Bayesian statistics. The Fisher-information matrix is used to calculate the covariance matrices associated with maximum-likelihood estimates. It can also be used in the formu-lation of test statistics, such as the Wald test. Statistical systems of a scientific nature (physical, biologi-cal, etc.) whose likelihood functions obey shift invariance have been shown to obey maximum Fisher information. [3] The level of the maximum depends upon the nature of the system constraints. 1 Definition The Fisher information is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable random variable X car-ries about an unknown parameter θ upon which the prob-ability of X depends. The probability function for X, which is also the likelihood function for θ, is a function f(X; θ); it is the probability mass (or probability density) of the random variable X conditional on the value of θ. The partial derivative with respect to θ of the natural log-arithm of the likelihood function is called the score. Under certain regularity conditions, [4] it can be shown that the first moment of the score (that is, its expected value) is 0:},

We found that, all the daily growth rates for each index are well characterized by low, medium and high volatilities in different periods of time.

	abstract = {Previous work shows that average returns on common stocks are related to firm characteristics like size, earnings/price, cash flow/price, book-to-market equity, past sales growth, long-term past return, and short-term past return. Because these patterns in average returns apparently are not explained by the CAPM, they are called anomalies. We find that, except for the continuation of short-term returns, the anomalies largely disappear in a three-factor model. Our results are consistent with rational ICAPM or APT asset pricing, but we also consider irrational pricing and data problems as possible explanations. RESEARCHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED MANY patterns in average stock returns. For example , DeBondt and Thaler (1985) find a reversal in long-term returns; stocks with low long-term past returns tend to have higher future returns. In contrast , Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) find that short-term returns tend to continue; stocks with higher returns in the previous twelve months tend to have higher future returns. Others show that a firm's average stock return is related to its size (ME, stock price times number of shares), book-to-market-equity (BE/ME, the ratio of the book value of common equity to its market value), earnings/price (E/P), cash flow/price (C/P), and past sales growth. (Banz (1981), Basu (1983), Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), and Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1994).) Because these patterns in average stock returns are not explained by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), they are typically called anomalies. This paper argues that many of the CAPM average-return anomalies are related, and they are captured by the three-factor model in Fama and French (FF 1993). The model says that the expected return on a portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate [E(Ri)-Rf] is explained by the sensitivity of its return to three factors: (i) the excess return on a broad market portfolio (RM-Rf); (ii) the difference between the return on a portfolio of small stocks and the return on a portfolio of large stocks (SMB, small minus big); and (iii) the difference between the return on a portfolio of high-book-to-market stocks and the return on a portfolio of low-book-to-market stocks (HML, high minus low). Specifically , the expected excess return on portfolio i is, E(Ri)-Rf = bi[E(RM)-Rf] + siE(SMB) + hiE(HML), (1)},

The causal linkage between oil and stock markets is modelled using a vector autoregressive model with time-varying parameters so as to reflect changes in Granger causal-ity over time. A Markov switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model, in which causal link between the series is stochastic and governed by an unobservable Markov chain, is used for inferring time-varying causal-ity. Although we do not find any lead-lag type Granger causality, the results based on the MS-VAR model clearly show that oil futures price has strong regime prediction power for a sub-grouping of S\&P 500 stock index during various sub-periods in the sample, while there is a weak evidence for the regime prediction power of a sub-grouping of S\&P 500 stock indexes. The regime-prediction non-causality tests on the MS-VAR model show that both variables are useful for making inference about the regime process and that the evidence on regime-prediction causality is primarily found in the equation describing a sub-grouping of S\&P 500 stock market returns. The evidence from the conditional non-causality tests shows that past information on the other series fails to improve the one step ahead prediction for both oil futures and stock returns.},

Ciudad de México, 22 de febrero de 2021.-La AMAFORE realizó el Seminario Digital Inversiones Responsables: Fortalecimiento de la adopción de criterios que consideren factores ambientales, sociales y de gobierno corporativo (ASG). Durante el panel inaugural estuvieron presentes autoridades que también son especialistas en el tema: Gabriel Yorio González, Subsecretario de Hacienda y Crédito Público; Rafael del Villar Alrich, representante del Banco de México; Alba Aguilar Prieto, directora del Consejo Consultivo de Finanzas Verdes, y Bernardo González Rosas, Presidente de AMAFORE. Bernardo González Rosas, presidente de la AMAFORE, remarcó que el seminario se realiza en el marco de la creación de un subcomité dentro de la Asociación: el Subcomité de inversiones sustentables, que analizará las mejores prácticas en la materia, buscando ser pionero en el tema de inversiones responsables ya que será la manera en la que el sector financiero operará en el futuro cercano. "Tenemos, a partir de hoy, run área especializada que le dé seguimiento a estos temas y será coordinado por Gabriela Luna Zambrano", indicó González Rosas. El Subsecretario Yorio inició su participación señalando que, una vez que la recuperación económica esté en marcha, es un buen momento para caminar hacia un crecimiento verde en el mediano y largo plazo, la CONSAR tiene previsto que las inversiones ASG representen 38\% de las inversiones totales. También indicó que, gracias a la reforma al sistema de ahorro para el retiro, las Afores van a captar más recursos que pueden ser usados siguiendo regímenes de inversión que tengan impacto en la sostenibilidad de mediano y largo plazo del país, en beneficio de los trabajadores. El Subsecretario de Hacienda subrayó que la pandemia de COVID-19 puso en claro no solo la falta de inclusión financiera, sino también la desigualdad en la digitalización, y considera que la agenda ASG debe ir evolucionando e incluir nuevos criterios conforme se revelan fuentes de desigualdad. Rafael del Villar, representante del Banco de México, indicó que los mercados financieros y los inversionistas institucionales pueden enverdecer y hacer sostenible la economía y, de esta manera, influir en la economía real.

This paper introduces the simple variance swap, a more robust relative of the variance swap that can be priced and hedged even if the underlying asset's price can jump, and constructs SVIX, an index based on simple variance swaps that measures market volatility. SVIX is consistently lower than VIX in the time series, which rules out the possibility that the market return and stochastic discount factor are conditionally lognormal. The SVIX index points to an equity premium that-in contrast to the prevailing view in the literature-is extraordinarily volatile and that spiked dramatically at the height of the recent crisis.},

The jump diffusion, as well as other parameters of the underlying stock's dynamics, is modulated by a Markov chain representing different states of the market. A semi-closed-form pricing formula is derived by applying the generalized Fourier transform method. The counterpart pricing formula for a variance swap with continuous sampling times is also derived and compared with the discrete price to show the improvement of accuracy in our solution. Moreover, a semi-Monte-Carlo simulation is also presented in comparison with the two semi-closed-form pricing formulas. Finally, the effect of incorporating jump and regime switching on the strike price is investigated via numerical analysis.},

Abstract: Information extracted from financial derivatives on interest rates is commonly used to forecast movements in such rates. Yet, such an extraction generally assumes that agents are risk-neutral. Thus, it might be useful to account for their risk-aversion when doing forecasts. This can be done adding a risk-correction. In this context, we use TIIE-28 swaps to forecast changes in monetary policy in Mexico, using financial variables to account for the risk-correction. We assess whether models with a risk-correction outperform the TIIE-28 swaps rates. Their in-sample explained variability improves when using a risk-correction. Our main model's out-of-sample forecasts are similar for short horizons (3-month), and statistically better for longer horizons (9 to 24-month), compared to the direct use of TIIE-28 swaps interest rates.},

Publicar una nueva tasa de referencia que cumpla con todas las características recomendadas por la IOSCO y que refleje las condiciones de fondeo al mayoreo interbancario y con casas de bolsa, para operaciones de reporto con valores gubernamentales, así como con los emitidos por el Banco de México y el Instituto para la Protección al Ahorro Bancario (IPAB), a plazo de un día en México. Esta tasa será denominada TIIE de Fondeo a un día hábil bancario (TIIE de Fondeo a un día) y para ello el Banco de México realiza las siguientes acciones: a. A partir del 16 de enero del presente año, el Banco de México publicará diariamente la TIIE de Fondeo a un día en su página de Internet www.banxico.org.mx. Con el objetivo de dotar a los participantes del mercado con series históricas de la nueva tasa, estas contendrán información desde enero de 2006. b. La Circular 3/2012 publicada por el Banco de México se modificó a fin de establecer la metodología de la TIIE de Fondeo a un día y para que la nueva tasa sea considerada como referencia para las operaciones pasivas con tasa de interés variable de la banca. Cabe mencionar que dicha Circular atiende los comentarios recibidos en la consulta pública que estuvo vigente del 1 de noviembre al 15 de noviembre de 2019. 1 El FSB recomienda que las tasas de referencia cumplan con los principios establecidos por la IOSCO. Dichos principios tienen como objetivo dar legitimidad a la determinación de dichas tasas abordando aspectos relevantes como gobernanza, metodología de cálculo, rendición de cuentas y calidad de la tasa de referencia.

Esta última esta asociada al conjunto de acciones a través de las cuales la autoridad monetaria determina las condiciones bajo las cuales proporciona el dinero que circula en la economía, con lo cual influye en el comportamiento de la tasa de interés de corto plazo. La definición de los objetivos que debe perseguir la política monetaria ha sido un tema que ha ocupado a los economistas y a la opinión pública desde que los bancos centrales se consolidaron como las entidades responsables de proveer a las economías de moneda nacional y de instrumentar la política monetaria. Al respecto, y en paralelo con los avances académicos y la experiencia en la materia, el entendimiento sobre la política monetaria ha evolucionado considerablemente en las últimas décadas. Actualmente, ha quedado claro tanto en círculos académicos como entre las autoridades monetarias alrededor del mundo, que la mejor contribución que la política monetaria puede hacer para fomentar el crecimiento económico sostenido es procurando la estabilidad de precios. Por tanto, en años recientes muchos países, incluyendo a México, han reorientado los objetivos de la política monetaria de forma que el objetivo prioritario del banco central sea el procurar la estabilidad de precios. Este objetivo se ha formalizado, en la mayoría de los casos, con el establecimiento de metas de inflación en niveles bajos. Al respecto, es importante mencionar que el banco central no tiene un control directo sobre los precios ya que éstos se determinan como resultado de la interacción entre la oferta y demanda de diversos bienes o servicios. Sin embargo, a través de la política monetaria el banco central puede influir sobre el proceso de determinación de precios y así cumplir con su meta de inflación. Lo anterior sugiere que para la autoridad monetaria es sumamente importante conocer los efectos que sus acciones tienen sobre la economía en general y, particularmente, sobre el proceso de determinación de precios. El estudio de los canales a través de los cuales se presentan dichos efectos se conoce como mecanismo de transmisión de la política monetaria. Este se ilustra, a grandes rasgos, en el Diagrama 1.},

	abstract = {El Banco de México tiene como objetivo prioritario procurar la estabilidad del poder adquisitivo de la moneda nacional. Para alcanzar el control sobre la inflación que requiere este mandato, el Instituto Central debe definir un objetivo operacional que guíe la instrumentación de su política monetaria. A partir del 21 de enero de 2008, el Banco de México adoptó como objetivo operacional la tasa de interés interbancaria a un día ("tasa de fondeo bancario") en sustitución del saldo sobre las cuentas corrientes que la banca mantiene en el propio Banco (objetivo conocido como el "corto"). Un banco central no puede controlar directamente la inflación ni las variables que la determinan. Sin embargo, los bancos centrales sí cuentan con los instrumentos necesarios para afectar de manera directa a un grupo de variables nominales que a su vez tienen impacto sobre los determinantes de la inflación. A este grupo de variables se les conoce como "objetivos operacionales" y comprenden, entre otras, a las tasas de interés de corto plazo y a los saldos de las cuentas corrientes de la banca en el banco central. En la instrumentación de la política monetaria el banco central debe elegir uno de estos objetivos operacionales. A partir de 2003 el Banco de México realizó algunas modificaciones en la instrumentación de su política monetaria. En primer lugar, el objetivo sobre las cuentas corrientes de la banca dejó de fijarse sobre los saldos acumulados y comenzó a determinarse sobre el saldo final diario. Adicionalmente, el Banco decidió establecer fechas predeterminadas para dar a conocer su postura de política monetaria. Posteriormente, considerando el desarrollo del mercado financiero local y que la inflación que se iba consolidando en niveles bajos el Banco de México llevó a cabo una posterior modificación a la conducción de la política monetaria. Utilizando el objetivo de inflación de largo plazo previamente definido a partir de 2001, el Banco de México consideró que era necesario ser más específico sobre el nivel deseado de la tasa de interés y llevó a cabo una serie de medidas encaminadas a adoptar un objetivo operacional de tasas de interés. De esta manera, se eliminó el objetivo operacional sobre el saldo diario ("corto") y se sustituyó por una tasa objetivo para las operaciones de fondeo bancario a plazo de un día a partir de enero de 2008.},

	abstract = {We propose a theory of securities market under-and overreactions based on two well-known psychological biases: investor overconfidence about the precision of private information; and biased self-attribution, which causes asymmetric shifts in investors' confidence as a function of their investment outcomes. We show that overconfidence implies negative long-lag autocorrelations, excess volatility, and, when managerial actions are correlated with stock mispricing, public-event-based return predictability. Biased self-attribution adds positive short-lag autocorrela-tions ("momentum"), short-run earnings "drift," but negative correlation between future returns and long-term past stock market and accounting performrance. The theory also offers several untested implications and implications for corporate financial policy. IN RECENT YEARS A BODY OF evidence on security returns has presented a sharp challenge to the traditional view that securities are rationally priced to reflect all publicly available information. Some of the more pervasive anomalies can be classified as follows (Appendix A cites the relevant literature): 1. Event-based return predictability (public-event-date average stock returns of the same sign as average subsequent long-run abnormal performance) 2. Short-term momentum (positive short-term autocorrelation of stock returns , for individual stocks and the market as a whole)},

Agents are subject to various psychological tensions induced by market conditions and endowed with a minimal 'personality'. This personality consists of a threshold level for each of the tensions being modeled, and the agent reacts whenever a tension threshold is reached. This paper considers an elementary model including just two such tensions. The first is 'cowardice', which is the stress caused by remaining in a minority position with respect to overall market sentiment and leads to herding-type behavior. The second is 'inaction', which is the increasing desire to act or re-evaluate one's investment position. There is no inductive learning by agents and they are only coupled via the global market price and overall market sentiment. Even incorporating just these two psychological tensions, important stylized facts of real market data, including fat-tails, excess kurtosis, uncorrelated price returns and clustered volatility over the timescale of a few days are reproduced. By then introducing an additional parameter that amplifies the effect of externally generated market noise during times of extreme market sentiment, long-time volatility correlations can also be recovered. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, correcting contemporaneous market pricing errors is probably not government's relative advantage.

This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

The level of uncertainty is significantly higher in developing countries and is positively associated with economic policy uncertainty and stock market volatility, and negatively with GDP growth.

We use these indicators to document and quantify the enormous increase in economic uncertainty in the past several weeks. We also illustrate how these forward-looking measures can be used to assess the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Specifically, we feed COVID-induced first-moment and uncertainty shocks into an estimated model of disaster effects developed by Baker, Bloom and Terry (2020). Our illustrative exercise implies a year-on-year contraction in U.S. real GDP of nearly 11 percent as of 2020 Q4, with a 90 percent confidence interval extending to a nearly 20 percent contraction.

In this case, the linear and asymmetric Granger causality approaches of Toda-Yamamoto and Hatemi-J are respectively applied to provide useful insight. Although only significant evidence of linear Granger causality is found among the unemployment rate and the house prices in all the four economies, the investigations revealed asymmetric evidence involving the world pandemic uncertainty. Specifically, there is a significant uni-directional asymmetric Granger causality from the world pandemic uncertainty to the house price in France, Germany, and the USA but not in the UK. The variation in the results among the examined countries is explained by potential differences in economic structures or business cycle and other social and economic factors. Thus, relevant policy guidance is implied from the results especially for the policymakers in the examined countries.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land is a main component of the environment and ecological system. Therefore, this study employs the panel cointegration approach to investigate the dynamic relationship between the housing market vis-à-vis housing price (hp) and agricultural land (land) of a panel of 15 countries (countries with the gross domestic product–weighted average of the national Economic Policy Uncertainty index) over the period 1997–2015. Additionally, Granger causality approach of Dumitrescu–Hurlin is employed for the investigation. The model adjusts to the long-run equilibrium with an annual speed of 11\% from any situation of disequilibrium and with elasticities of −3.97 and −0.67, respectively, for a land and Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (gepu). Meanwhile, the impact during a short run of gepu is statistically significant and positive on hp, whereas it is not significant for land. Interestingly, the investigation reveals Granger causality from agricultural land to the housing price with feedback. The research presents an indication that policymaker(s) and urbanization stakeholders should be more concern about effective and sustainable long-term policies. Future anomalies of food scarcity and skyrocketing house prices associated with agricultural land–house price trade-off challenges could potentially be mitigated by such effective policy frameworks.},

	abstract = {The events that occurred after the worldwide diffusion of COVID-19 provide a real-life example of how uncertainty can severely affect the global economy. This paper reviews literature on the negative impacts of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) as developed by Baker et al., The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016, 131, 1593–1636 on individuals, businesses, governments, and economies at the local and international levels. This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto-currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management. Our results lead us to consider the gravity of economic policy uncertainty and call for innovation across different sectors to mitigate its adverse effects.},

Design/methodology/approach: The sample covers 1,630 unique firms and 30,369 unique directors covering a ten-year period to investigate the effects of religiosity and educational attainment. Findings: The analysis reveals that while the number of women has increased in general terms, this change is mostly limited to boards that are increasing in size. Women do not tend to replace exiting male board members but are appointed when the board size grows. Therefore, while the number of women is increasing in absolute terms, they are not increasing in relative terms. In areas where religiosity is high, as measured by church affiliation and attendance, female participation in the boardroom is lower and a more educated and qualified female population leads to higher board participation. These effects supersede any regional effects. Originality/value: The study adds insights into corporate board dynamic, providing new evidence concerning the impact of local conditions on board composition as well as additional information concerning the interplay of board dynamics and female board representation.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is a task related to understanding people's feelings in written text; the starting point would be to identify the polarity level (positive, neutral or negative) of a given text, moving on to identify emotions or whether a text is humorous or not. This task has been the subject of several research competitions in a number of languages, e.g., English, Spanish, and Arabic, among others. In this contribution, we propose an SA system, namely EvoMSA, that unifies our participating systems in various SA competitions, making it domain-independent and multilingual by processing text using only languageindependent techniques. EvoMSA is a classifier, based on Genetic Programming that works by combining the output of different text classifiers to produce the final prediction. We analyzed EvoMSA on different SA competitions to provide a global overview of its performance. The results indicated that EvoMSA is competitive obtaining top rankings in several SA competitions. Furthermore, we performed an analysis of EvoMSA's components to measure their contribution to the performance; the aim was to facilitate a practitioner or newcomer to implement a competitive SA classifier. Finally, it is worth to mention that EvoMSA is available as open-source software.},

We use a unique dataset of more than 4000 firms from 58 countries during 2002-2011. Primary analysis surprisingly shows that ESG controversies are associated with greater firm value. However, when interacted with the corporate social performance (CSP) score, ESG controversies are found to have no direct effect on firm value while the interaction appears to be highly and significantly positive. Building on this evidence, we attempt to explore the channels through which CSP may enhance market value. Conducting sample split analysis indicates that higher CSP score has an impact on market value only for high-attention firms, those firms which are larger, perform better, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and have an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, our findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP.},

Design/methodology/approach-An algorithm has been developed for calculating the sentiment orientation and score of data with added information, and the results of calculation have been integrated to construct an empirical model for calculating stock market volatility. Findings-The experimental results reveal a statistically significant relationship between financial news and stock market volatility. Moreover, positive (negative) news is found to be positively (negatively) correlated with positive stock returns, and the score of added information of the news is positively correlated with stock returns. Model verification and stock market volatility predictions are verified over four time periods (monthly, quarterly, semiannually and annually). The results show that the prediction accuracy of the models approaches 66\% and stock market volatility with a particular trend-predicting effect in specific periods by using moving window evaluation. Research limitations/implications-Only one news source is used and the research period is only two years; thus,futurestudiesshouldincorporateseveraldatasourcesandusealongerperiodtoconductamorein-depthanalysis. Practical implications-Understanding trends in stock market volatility can decrease risk and increase profit from investment. Therefore, individuals or businesses can feasibly engage in investment activities for profit by understanding volatility trends in capital markets. Originality/value-The ability to exploit textual information could potentially increase the quality of the data. Few scholars have applied sentiment analysis in investigating interdisciplinary topics that cover information management technology, accounting and finance. Furthermore, few studies have provided support for structured and unstructured data. In this paper, the efficiency of providing the algorithm, the model and the trend in stock market volatility has been demonstrated.},

By calculated the increments of the attention volume for each stock (IAVS) from the stock trading platforms, we investigate the effect of investors' attention measured by the IAVS on the movement of the stock market. The experimental results for Chi-nese Securities Index 100 (CSI100) show that the BI is significantly correlated with the returns of CSI100 at 1\% significance level only in 2014. However, it should be emphasized that the correlation of the new proposed measure, namely IAVS, is significantly at 1\% significance level in 2014 and 2015. It shows that the effect of the measure IAVS on the movement of the stock market is more stable and significant than BI.

	abstract = {The growth of financial texts in the wake of big data has challenged most organizations and brought escalating demands for analysis tools. In general, text streams are more challenging to handle than numeric data streams. Text streams are unstructured by nature, but they represent collective expressions that are of value in any financial decision. It can be both daunting and necessary to make sense of unstructured textual data. In this study, we address key questions related to the explosion of interest in how to extract insight from unstructured data and how to determine if such insight provides any hints concerning the trends of financial markets. A sentiment analysis engine (SAE) is proposed which takes advantage of linguistic analyses based on grammars. This engine extends sentiment analysis not only at the word token level, but also at the phrase level within each sentence. An assessment heuristic is applied to extract the collective expressions shown in the texts. Also, three evaluations are presented to assess the performance of the engine. First, several standard parsing evaluation metrics are applied on two treebanks. Second, a benchmark evaluation using a dataset of English movie review is conducted. Results show our SAE outperforms the traditional bag of words approach. Third, a financial text stream with twelve million words that aligns with a stock market index is examined. The evaluation results and their statistical significance provide strong evidence of a long persistence in the mood time series generated by the engine. In addition, our approach establishes grounds for belief that the sentiments expressed through text streams are helpful for analyzing the trends in a stock market index, although such sentiments and market indices are normally considered to be completely uncorrelated.},

We found that Twitter sentiment and posting volume were relevant for the forecasting of returns of S\&P 500 index, portfolios of lower market capitalization and some industries. Additionally, KF sentiment was informative for the forecasting of returns. Moreover, Twitter and KF sentiment indicators were useful for the prediction of some survey sentiment indicators. These results confirm the usefulness of microblogging data for financial expert systems, allowing to predict stock market behavior and providing a valuable alternative for existing survey measures with advantages (e.g., fast and cheap creation, daily frequency).},

Emotional sentiment about a firm's stock that spreads rapidly through social media is more likely to be incorporated quickly into stock prices (e.g., on the same trading day it was expressed), while sentiment that spreads slowly takes longer to be incorporated into stock prices and thus is more likely to predict stock prices on future days. We analyzed the cumulative sentiment (positive and negative) in 2.5 million Twitter postings about individual S\&P 500 firms and compared this to the stock returns of those firms. Our results show that the sentiment in tweets about a specific firm from users with less than 171 followers (the median in our sample) had a significant impact on the stock's returns on the next trading day, the next 10 days, and the next 20 days. Interestingly, sentiment in tweets from users with fewer than 171 followers that were not retweeted had the greatest impact on future stock returns. A trading strategy based on these findings produced meaningful economic gains on the order of an 11–15\% annual return.},

Nonetheless, knowing whether a particular event is expressed on Twitter is a challenging task that requires a considerable collection of tweets. This proposal aims to facilitate, a researcher interested in Twitter data, the process of mining events on Twitter. The events could be related to natural disasters, health issues, people's mobility, among other studies that can be pursued with the library proposed. Different applications are presented in this contribution to illustrate the library's capabilities, starting from an exploratory analysis of the topics discovered in tweets, following it by studying the similarity among dialects of the Spanish language, and complementing it with a mobility report on different countries. In summary, the Python library presented retrieves a plethora of information processed from Twitter (since December 2015) in terms of words, bigrams of words, and their frequencies by day for Arabic, English, Spanish, and Russian languages. Finally, the mobility information considered is related to the number of travels among locations for more than 245 countries or territories.},

In this paper we investigate the relations between a well-known micro-blogging platform Twitter and financial markets. In particular, we consider, in a period of 15 months, the Twitter volume and sentiment about the 30 stock companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. We find a relatively low Pearson correlation and Granger causality between the corresponding time series over the entire time period. However, we find a significant dependence between the Twitter sentiment and abnormal returns during the peaks of Twitter volume. This is valid not only for the expected Twitter volume peaks (e.g., quarterly announcements), but also for peaks corresponding to less obvious events. We formalize the procedure by adapting the well-known "event study" from economics and finance to the analysis of Twitter data. The procedure allows to automatically identify events as Twitter volume peaks, to compute the prevailing sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in tweets at these peaks, and finally to apply the "event study" methodology to relate them to stock returns. We show that sentiment polarity of Twitter peaks implies the direction of cumulative abnormal returns. The amount of cumulative abnormal returns is relatively low (about 1-2\%), but the dependence is statistically significant for several days after the events.},

The analysis shows that 13F institutions with better sustainability footprints outperform. The positive effect of sustainability footprints on the risk-adjusted performance of 13F institutions’ equity portfolios is concentrated in the environmental dimension and in more recent periods. Further tests show that the outperformance is explained by growing investor preferences for sustainable investing over time and the resulting price pressure that institutions exert on stocks with good environmental scores.},

MSCI’s BarraOne and Barra Portfolio Manager can provide this utility with Intangible Value Assessment (IVA) ratings from MSCI ESG Research.   In this study, we examine the use of IVA ratings with the Barra Global Equity Model (GEM3) to build optimized portfolios with improved ESG ratings, while keeping risk, performance, country, industry, and style characteristics similar to conventional benchmarks, such as the MSCI World Index.  The currently available dataset of IVA scores allowed us to compare three strategies during the period between February 2008 and December 2012, using current IVA ratings methodology.  Of the three strategies, we found the best active returns during this period were achieved by overweighting firms whose IVA ratings improved over the recent time period, showing ESG momentum.  Underweighting assets with low ESG ratings also raised portfolio performance during this period.  The highest ESG rated assets had more uneven performance; they generally did better in periods of limited risk appetite during this volatile market cycle.},

This results in an ethic-free and often inimical approach to virtuous behaviour.

	abstract = {This paper marks a radical diversion from the large body of prevailing literature in business ethics which primarily views the issue in individual-personal terms, i.e., corporate executive and employee, and suggests that making corporations more ethical would primarily come through changes in executive behavior. While this approach has strong intellectual roots in moral philosophy and religion, it fails in explaining the persistence of unethical and illegal behavior among corporations of all sizes, financial health, competitive market conditions, and, level of individual executive compensation. This paper argues for a fundamentally different approach to understanding ethical behavior, or lack thereof, among corporations and their executives. It is asserted that an overwhelmingly large rationale and/or inducement for proactive ethical business behavior is rooted in competitive aspects of particular markets, and industry structures prevailing in those markets. Furthermore, while highly competitive markets may promote efficiency, they do not guarantee ethical behavior and may indeed provide greater opportunities and incentives for unethical business behavior. Thus, by following the current prognosis, we could be wasting enormous resources in terms of teaching business ethics, and creating and imposing corporate codes of conduct. We assert that these approaches would at best make a marginal improvement in the ethical performance of corporations while at the same time exacerbate the problem by ignoring more fundamental, structural issues. Imperfect markets, with their above-market profits, are a necessary but insufficient condition for corporations to behave ethically. It is only under conditions of imperfect markets that individual executives can play an important role in guiding their corporations toward greater ethical norms. These are undertaken for a variety of reasons, including, protecting a corporation's good name, public expectations, competitive norms, and, corporate culture and individual executive's predilections, to name a few.},

This paper is divided into three parts. In the first part I demarcate some selected broad issues in relation to the general perspective of critical reflection. The next section outlines the in-depth consequences of general outlook in respect of critical scope of business ethics, that is to say, in this part the critical capacities of business ethics are to be examined in the light of general principles previously put down. This section focuses on some controversies, questions and debates on the scope of critical reflection in business ethics. The third part looks at the description of empirical tendencies relevant for the developing of practical rules and critical analysis in business ethics, and sets the proposal for the operationalisation of critical principles of business ethics.},

	abstract = {Complicating the current corporate governance controversy is a major disagreement about the fundamental purpose of the corporation. There are two main views on what should constitute the principal goal of the firm. Most economists tend to endorse value maximization—that is, maximization of the value of the firm's debt plus equity—or a version of value maximization known as “value-based management” (VBM) that aims to maximize shareholder value. The main challenger is “stakeholder theory,” which argues that the corporation exists to benefit not just investors but all its major constituencies—employees, customers, suppliers, the local community, and the federal government, as well as shareholders. Thus, whereas the success of a corporation under VBM could be assessed simply by its long-run return to shareholders, under stakeholder theory a company's success would be judged by taking account of its contributions to all its stakeholders. Using statistical analysis of various measures of corporate success in satisfying non-investor stakeholders, the author investigates whether a broader focus on multiple stakeholders is necessarily inconsistent with the pursuit of long-term shareholder value. His main findings in fact suggest just the opposite—namely, that long-term value creation appears to be a necessary condition for maintaining corporate investment in stakeholder relationships. More specifically, the author's study shows that companies with higher levels of value creation tend to have stronger reputations for treating stakeholders well while companies that create little value end up shortchanging not just their shareholders but all their constituencies. For profitable companies that have previously failed to devote the optimal level of resources to their non-investor stakeholders, the message of this article is that investing in stakeholders can add value—and, in fact, it pays for companies to spend an additional dollar on stakeholder relationships as long as the present value of the expected (long-run) return is at least a dollar.},

Panel regression analysis was used to examine the study hypotheses and achieve the study aims. Findings The results showed that ESG disclosure positively affects a firms’ performance measures. However, measuring ESG sub-components separately showed that environmental (EVN) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure is negatively associated with ROA and ROE. EVN and CSR disclosure is positively related to Tobin’s Q. Further, corporate governance (CG) disclosure is positively related to ROA and Tobin’s Q, and negatively related to ROE. More importantly, ESG, CSR, EVN and CG tend to be higher with firms that have high assets and high financial leverage. Furthermore, the higher level of ESG, EVN, CSR and CG disclosure, the higher the ROA and ROE. Originality/value The study limns a vision of the role of ESG on firm performance.

The model satisfies many appealing properties, and it provides a useful benchmark when one conceptualizes how market value relates to accounting data and other information. Résumé.

	abstract = {Sobre la prelación de las restricciones al crecimiento económico: abogando por la perspectiva basada en la huella ecológicaAnalizamos la relación entre los mercados cambiarios y el proceso de integración de los mercados bursátiles de América Latina (MILA), centrando el análisis en dos puntos. Primero, evaluamos la existencia y la naturaleza de un premio por riesgo cambiario y su relación con el sesgo de la paridad descubierta de interés (UIP). Segundo, analizamos el efecto de MILA en los mercados cambiarios latinoamericanos. Utilizamos series de tiempo mensuales entre enero de 1997 y diciembre de 2021 para los mercados cambiarios de Brasil, Chile, Colombia, México y Perú. El análisis econométrico se basa en regresiones OLS, GARCH-in-mean y DCC-MGARCH. Nuestros resultados indican que la UIP no se cumple. Incluso los resultados de los modelos GARCH-in-mean indican que no hay un premio por riesgo individual que corrija el sesgo de la UIP. Sin embargo, los resultados del modelo DCC-MGARCH muestran que existe una prima por riesgo generada simultáneamente por la correlación entre mercados. MILA incrementó las correlaciones dinámicas de los retornos cambiarios y de los premios por riesgo, principalmente entre los mercados MILA. Estos resultados tienen implicancias para inversores y policymakers.},

Con respecto del diseño de los planes para el retiro, en un marco de sistemas deficientes de pensiones, las investigaciones de Merton (1969) y (1971) sobre reglas óptimas de consumo y portafolio durante y después de la vida laboral cobran vigencia contemporánea. Asimismo, Bodie y Merton (2002) proponen el uso de productos derivados, en el ámbito internacional, para diversificar los riesgos de los sistemas de pensiones justo en el momento en que muchos de éstos, en economías subdesarrolladas e industrializadas, están en la antesala de colapso; además de que varios de estos sistemas sólo garantizan una proporción exigua del salario. Por último, la teoría racional de valuación de opciones de Merton (1973) se retoma para crear oleoductos y plantas generadoras de energía sintéticas  mediante el uso de contratos derivados. Este trabajo pretende realizar una revisión de las tendencias y perspectivas de la ciencia financiera y las finanzas matemáticas, en el marco de las contribuciones pioneras de Robert Cox Merton, resaltando áreas prioritarias que ofrecen oportunidades para realizar investigación con impactos social y global.},

The relationship of HPWS with firm performance has been extensively examined, though the mechanism underlying HPWS—performance relationship is not well researched, especially at the organizational level. Based on the dynamic capabilities perspective, this study examines a model with adaptive capability as the mediator in the relationship between HPWS and firm performance, aiming to understand how HPWS is positively associated with organizational outcomes. Institutional environment as a contextual factor that influences the relationship between adaptive capability and performance is also examined. Empirical results from a sample of Chinese firms indicated that HPWS—firm performance linkage was partially mediated by adaptive capability. In addition, the effect of HPWS on adaptive capability was stronger for firms in an institutional environment with location advantage than firms in other environments.},

The results showed that the implementation of HPWPs was associated with subsequent and sustained increases in productivity and safety performance. The study suggests that a specifically designed intervention involving HPWPs can have beneficial effects both on productivity and safety, but other intermediary variables associated with the implementation process may be critical in mitigating potentially detrimental worker welfare effects arising from work intensification.},

	abstract = {It is challenging for enterprises that lack innovation and creativity to survive successfully in the market. Employee top role performance is not always sufficient to gain a competitive advantage, in which innovative behaviors and creativity can be counted as necessary ingredients to build. This study proposed and tested employee innovative behaviors (IB) and creativity as mediator and moderator, respectively, of the impact of high-performance work practices (HPWPs) on sustainable competitive advantage (CA). The resource-based view and job demands resources model provided the theoretical underpinnings for the developed hypotheses that were tested using a sample of 323 customer-contact employees of 4- and 5-star hotels. The results indicated that HPWP indirectly predicted CA via IB. Also, creativity moderated the impact of HPWPs on innovative behaviors positively and on competitive advantage negatively. Employee innovative behaviors can generate substantial returns to service organizations competing with quasi-homogeneous end-products. The relevant theoretical and practical implications are further discussed. The scope of the study calls for caution in the generalizability of the overall findings. The research acknowledges the need to extend the findings by explicitly accounting for national cultural profiles. This study fills the dearth of research in service innovation in the hotel industry by testing the mediating effect of IB on the HPWPs CA nexus and reveals the moderating role that employee creative traits have in these relationships.},

Furthermore, this study investigates how organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) and positive psychological capital (PPC) affect the relationship between HPWPs and outcomes of employees such as EIRP and ETP. A quantitative technique based on the survey method was used to gather the primary data of the investigation. Two hundred and eleven bank employees working in different banks of Punjab and Pakistan participated in the survey process. The PROCESS-macro was used to test the relationship among the study constructs. Our results supported all the study hypotheses, however positive psychological capital did not moderate the indirect effect of high performance work practices on employee's task performance via organization based self-esteem. This study is the earliest of its kind that focuses on HPWPs and outcomes of employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country like Pakistan. The findings of this study provide practical implications in the post and continuing pandemic situation for organizations to human resource management to redesign workforce strategies to increase their contribution and responses to realize organizational priorities. Although researchers have explored the topic in different sectors, scant studies have investigated the potential impact, barriers, and enabling mechanisms that function as a catalyst in HPWPs during the pandemic situation.},

HPWPs are theoretically linked to gender concepts, followed by an empirical analysis of whether these HPWPs have different effects on job satisfaction for men and women. The results of the theoretical analysis highlight that HPWPs are primarily oriented to the male gender concept. The empirical analysis is based on data from the European Working Condition Survey for Germany (N = 1,044). The results show that gender partially acts as a moderator in the relationships between HPWPs and job satisfaction. The study contributes to the literature by providing deeper and differentiated insights into the relationships between HPWPs and job satisfaction by providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for how HPWPs can affect men and women differently and by empirically analyzing the extents of these relationships.},

	abstract = {High-performance work practices (HPWP) have been found to increase financial performance. Institutional theory suggests that this effect may be moderated by labor market institutions, such as labor market flexibility and labor market efficiency. We explore this relationship using a combined data set comprised of data on HPWP from ASSET4, financial and other company-level data from the Worldscope Database, and national institutional context data from the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report. With an international sample of roughly 20,000 archival firm-year observations across a seven-year period, we use pooled OLS regression models with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. We find support for all predicted relationships except for a direct relationship between labor market flexibility and performance: Strong formal institutional pressure (low labor market flexibility) increases the positive financial impact of HPWP. Strong informal institutional pressure (high labor market efficiency) affects the financial performance of businesses directly and positively, and also indirectly by increasing the positive effect of HPWP on financial performance. We conclude that companies seeking the most financially-rewarding approach to human resource management (HRM) should engage in HPWP, encourage the local population to expect and value such practices (e.g., by promoting women’s rights), and, counterintuitively, encourage more government regulation of business around HRM practices.},

	abstract = {Although high-performance work practices (HPWPs) have been shown to increase organizational performance and improve employee attitudes, it still remains unclear how they impact interpersonal relations in the workplace. While some argue that HPWPs lead to better interpersonal relations, others fear that HPWPs may increase competition and uncivil and abusive behaviors. In response to this, our aim is to examine whether and when HPWPs are associated with increased levels of competition and thereby more incivility. Given recent interest in how HR practices and leadership may interact to produce certain outcomes, we study laissez-faire leadership as a possible moderator. A survey was conducted in Belgium (n = 374), and a mediated moderation analysis using SEM performed using Mplus. The results suggest that in the absence of laissez-faire leadership, HPWPs are associated with less incivility, thus suggesting better interpersonal relations. However, the results also show that HPWPs may lead to increased competition and thereby somewhat more incivility, under conditions of laissez-faire leadership. The results thus point to the importance of studying interactions between HR practices and leadership in trying to understand employee outcomes. In terms of practical implications, the results suggest that investing in HPWPs may reduce incivility and thereby improve relationship wellbeing. However, HPWPs need to be combined with active leadership to avoid undesirable negative consequences.},

This research surveyed 154 service sector employees at Klang Valley, Malaysia. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Based on the ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) theory, the results indicate that motivation and opportunity practices have a significant positive effect on EWB, whereas ability enhancing practices have an insignificant effect. Human resource policies and practices must foster a conducive yet contented work environment, and leaders must provide opportunities and motivation for employees to participate actively in the workplace. By doing so, the organisation’s value of human resources can be significantly increased, and the organisation’s goals can be achieved while employees’ overall well-being is enhanced, resulting in a win-win situation. This study uncovers the important roles of AMO practices that can effectively increase EWB.},

The adverse consequences of the GPR index are driven by both the threat and the realization of adverse geopolitical events. We complement our aggregate measures with industry- and firm-level indicators of geopolitical risk. Investment drops more in industries that are exposed to aggregate geopolitical risk.

A Lagrange Multiplier test against misspecification of the within-regime correlation dynamics is proposed, and a simple recursion for multi-step-ahead conditional covariance matrices is deduced. We use this methodology to model the dynamics of the joint distribution of global stock market and real estate equity returns. The empirical analysis highlights the importance of the conditional distribution in Markovswitching time series models. Specifications with Student’s t innovations dominate their Gaussian counterparts both in- and out-of-sample. The dominating specification appears to be a two-regime Student’s t process with correlations which are higher in the turbulent (high-volatility) regime.},

In a globalized environment that demands greater competitiveness, trade agreements and synergies between trade blocs through maritime transport allow commercial development between economies. This research analyzes the relationship between international trade through seaports and investment in the countries that make up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from 1997 to 2017. An econometric panel data model is used to measure the relationship between the variables, and unit root tests, cointegration tests (Kao and Fisher-Johansen tests), and heterogeneous causality tests (Hurlin and Dumitrescu test) are performed. The results show a positive relationship between trade and productivity, as well as a positive relationship between commerce and direct foreign investment; hence, an increase in investment causes a growth in international trade between Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

The ideal climatic conditions and favorable yields have spurred an interest in growing new orchards for enhancing avocado production. Such growth has a major impact on the environment due to the land use change and the substantial use of fresh water. Therefore, there is a need for an optimal strategic planning for the avocado production while accounting for the sustainable use of the available resources. This paper presents an optimization model for the optimal strategic planning of avocado production to satisfy the current and future demands while simultaneously accounting for the environmental impact (caused by land and water use) and economic factors. The proposed model is based on a new mathematical programming formulation. The results show that with proper planning, it is possible to satisfy the future demands for avocado while protecting the environment and achieving economic gains.},

	abstract = {Objective Do positive export shocks fuel or dampen criminal violence? The predation mechanism predicts that increasing export revenue generates a larger contested resource, and it prompts more violence by increasing the expected benefit of expropriation. The opportunity cost mechanism instead argues that an increase in exports may deter individuals from engaging in criminal activity, as it drives up labor demand and wages in the formal labor market. I test these competing claims using a case of the Mexican avocado industry. Method I test these claims by estimating a causal effect of avocado production on criminal violence in Mexico. I further address the endogeneity issue with an instrumental variable approach, exploiting exogenous variations in climatic conditions that affect agricultural crop yields. Result Moving from the lowest to the highest level of monthly avocado production, this positive change in avocado production reduces the homicide rate by 0.65 per hundred thousand relative to the average monthly homicide rate of 2.02. Conclusion This finding suggests that the opportunity cost effect is largely at play in the avocado-growing Mexican states, showing a new context of theory application. Limitations and future research avenues are discussed.},

It is worth mentioning that, between 2003 and 2018, the average annual growth rate of Mexican avocado imports in Canada was 14.72\%; while, from 2019 to 2021, this same rate averaged -4.65, that is, in this period Mexican avocado imports in Canada fell at an average annual rate of 4.65\%. This research aims to determine the viability of increasing the annual growth rate of Mexican avocado exports to the Canadian market. To carry out the work, the avocado market between Mexico and Canada was represented in an econometric model and, with the results, a partial equilibrium analysis was carried out, simulating a 50\% annual increase in exports. The results show that an increase in the amount of Mexican avocado exported to the Canadian market that results in an average annual growth rate of 50\% is viable in terms of income. The simulation shows that the Benefit/Cost Ratio (B/C R) in avocado production for the states of Jalisco, Michoacan and the State of Mexico, in the hypothetical scenario, would be 1.4831, 1.4257 and 1.5322 respectively.},

We use a spatial probit model to project the geographic distribution of likely future avocado expansion and analyze those results to determine (a) threats to specific forest types and (b) how the distribution of avocado is shifting spatially under current and future climate scenarios. Our results suggest that avocado expansion in Michoacán is strongly driven by distance to existing agriculture, roads, and localities, as well as the dwindling availability of Andosol soils. As future expansion ensues, it presents risk of forest loss across various forest types, with pine-oak forest, mesophilic montane forest, and oyamel fir forest being of particular concern. Moreover, our results suggest that avocado production will occupy wider ranges in terms of temperature, precipitation, slope steepness and soil. The model predicts that climate change will alter the spatial distribution of avocado plantings, expanding into forest types at lower and at higher elevations. Forest loss threatens ecosystem degradation, and a wider avocado crop production footprint could lead to orchard establishment into dwindling forests that host a high diversity of native oaks and charismatic species, including the monarch butterfly.},

	doi = {10.1111/ssqu.13198},
	abstract = {Objective Do positive export shocks fuel or dampen criminal violence? The predation mechanism predicts that increasing export revenue generates a larger contested resource, and it prompts more violence by increasing the expected benefit of expropriation. The opportunity cost mechanism instead argues that an increase in exports may deter individuals from engaging in criminal activity, as it drives up labor demand and wages in the formal labor market. I test these competing claims using a case of the Mexican avocado industry. Method I test these claims by estimating a causal effect of avocado production on criminal violence in Mexico. I further address the endogeneity issue with an instrumental variable approach, exploiting exogenous variations in climatic conditions that affect agricultural crop yields. Result Moving from the lowest to the highest level of monthly avocado production, this positive change in avocado production reduces the homicide rate by 0.65 per hundred thousand relative to the average monthly homicide rate of 2.02. Conclusion This finding suggests that the opportunity cost effect is largely at play in the avocado-growing Mexican states, showing a new context of theory application. Limitations and future research avenues are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1111/1746-692x.12289},
	abstract = {The market for avocados is among the fastest expanding markets worldwide, and consumption, particularly in North America and Europe, has increased during recent decades due largely to a combination of socio‐economic and marketing factors. Avocado production, however, is associated with significant water conflicts, stresses and hot spots, as well as with other negative environmental and socio‐economic impacts on local communities in the main production zones. In considering near‐future climatic change in tropical and subtropical areas where avocados are produced, an urgent road map is needed to avoid and mitigate negative effects of avocado production. This road map needs to bring authorities and policymakers together with large and small producers from areas with present and projected future water scarcity to evaluate the critical capacity and optimal levels of avocado production. The EU as one of the most important markets for this fruit could facilitate and support such a road map and at the same time critically promote imports from countries and regions where current and future severe water risk are not further threatened. Finally, consumer behaviour can contribute to minimising negative effects by making a conscious effort to engage in ethical consumption and environmental conservation, contributing to the sustainability of communities in producing areas. Le marche de l'avocat est l'un des marches a la croissance la plus rapide au monde. En effet, la consommation a augmente au cours des dernieres decennies, en particulier en Amerique du Nord et en Europe, en grande partie en raison d'une combinaison de facteurs socio‐economiques et de marketing. Or la production d'avocat est associee a d'importants conflits, stress et points chauds en termes d'utilisation de l'eau, ainsi qu’a d'autres impacts environnementaux et socio‐economiques negatifs sur les communautes locales dans les principales zones de production. En considerant le changement climatique proche dans les zones tropicales et subtropicales ou les avocats sont produits, une feuille de route urgente est necessaire pour eviter et attenuer les effets negatifs de la production d'avocat. Cette feuille de route doit rassembler les autorites et les decideurs politiques ainsi que les petits et grands producteurs des regions marquees par une penurie en eau qui se poursuivra selon les projections, afin d’evaluer la capacite critique et les niveaux optimaux de production d'avocat. Etant l'un des marches les plus importants pour ce fruit, l'Union europeenne pourrait faciliter et soutenir une telle feuille de route et en meme temps promouvoir de maniere critique les importations en provenance de pays et de regions ou les risques hydriques graves actuels et futurs ne sont plus une menace. Enfin, le comportement des consommateurs peut contribuer a minimiser les effets negatifs en faisant un effort conscient pour s'engager dans une consommation ethique et la conservation de l'environnement, contribuant ainsi a la durabilite des communautes dans les zones de production. Der Avocadomarkt gehort zu den am schnellsten wachsenden Markten weltweit. Der Verbrauch, insbesondere in Nordamerika und Europa, hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten vor allem aufgrund einer Kombination aus soziookonomischen und marketingbezogenen Faktoren zugenommen. Die Avocadoproduktion ist jedoch mit erheblichen Wasserkonflikten, Belastungen und Krisenherden verbunden sowie mit anderen negativen umweltbezogenen und soziookonomischen Auswirkungen auf die lokale Bevolkerung in den Hauptanbaugebieten. Angesichts des bevorstehenden Klimawandels in den tropischen und subtropischen Anbaugebieten wird ein Aktionsplan dringend benotigt, um die negativen Auswirkungen der Avocadoproduktion zu vermeiden und abzuschwachen. Dieser Aktionsplan muss Behorden und politische Entscheidungstragende mit grosen und kleinen Anbaubetrieben aus den Gebieten mit gegenwartiger und prognostizierter Wasserknappheit zusammenbringen, um die kritische Grose und das optimale Niveau der Avocadoproduktion zu bewerten. Die EU als einer der wichtigsten Markte fur diese Frucht konnte einen solchen Aktionsplan ermoglichen und unterstutzen. Gleichzeitig konnte sie Importe aus Landern und Regionen fordern, in denen gegenwartig und zukunftig keine Wasserrisiken befurchtet werden. Schlieslich kann auch das Verhalten der Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher dazu beitragen, die negativen Auswirkungen zu verringern. Dafur mussten sie sich bewusst um ethischen Konsum und Umweltschutz bemuhen, um so zur Nachhaltigkeit der Gemeinden in den Anbaugebieten beizutragen.},

	abstract = {The global avocado market has increased significantly in recent years. The state of Michoacan in Mexico is one of the largest producers of avocado in the world. The ideal climatic conditions and favorable yields have spurred an interest in growing new orchards for enhancing avocado production. Such growth has a major impact on the environment due to the land use change and the substantial use of fresh water. Therefore, there is a need for an optimal strategic planning for the avocado production while accounting for the sustainable use of the available resources. This paper presents an optimization model for the optimal strategic planning of avocado production to satisfy the current and future demands while simultaneously accounting for the environmental impact (caused by land and water use) and economic factors. The proposed model is based on a new mathematical programming formulation. The results show that with proper planning, it is possible to satisfy the future demands for avocado while protecting the environment and achieving economic gains.},

	abstract = {Abstract   The United States (U.S.) imports 87 percent of its avocados from a single Mexican region, Michoacan. Although environmental and social costs associated with avocado production are significant, consumers and retailers in the U.S. cannot clearly discern them in part due to complex, opaque supply chains. In this paper, we use a novel methodology, TRAcking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST), to reconstruct avocado supply chains between the U.S. retailers and Mexican producers and exporters. Using remote sensing and machine learning, we document how avocado plantations are associated with deforestation in Michoacan, whose forests are important reservoirs for biodiversity, especially for the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We estimate that {\textasciitilde}20\% of the total deforestation in Michoacan between 2001 and 2017 is associated with the expansion of avocado plantations. Despite these impacts, interviews reveal that industry associates (namely, representatives of firms and associations) do not consider avocado production to be a driver of deforestation in the region. This disconnect between actual and perceived environmental impacts can be addressed by the U.S. governmental agencies that play influential roles in regulating avocado imports for sanitary and health purposes and by the vertically integrated avocado trading firms that connect Michoacan packing houses to Kroger, Costco, and other prominent U.S. grocers. Key measures to make the U.S.–Mexico avocado supply chain more sustainable include conventional regulatory tools, greater transparency, and improved governance through multi-stakeholder initiatives.},

We assessed the degree of fragmentation and functional connectivity of the remaining temperate forest within the Avocado Belt and prioritized patches that contribute the most to connectivity using a network-based approach and modelling different seed and pollen dispersal scenarios, including two types of patch attributes (size and degree of conservation). As landscape transformation in the region is rapid and ongoing, we updated the land-use and land-cover maps through a supervised classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, improving the reliability of our analyses. Temperate forest is highly fragmented within the region: most patches are small ({\textless}30 ha), have a reduced core-area (28\%), and irregular shapes. The degree of connectivity is very low (0.06), dropping to 0.019 when the degree of conservation of patches was considered. The top 100 ranked patches of forest that support the connectivity of seeds and pollen have different characteristics (i.e., size and topology) that may be considered for implementing conservation and management strategies. Seed dispersal seems to be more threatened by fragmentation than pollen dispersal, and patches that are important for maintaining seed connectivity are embedded in the denser zone of avocado orchards.},

We use a comparative case study of four communities, an analysis of forest cover change, and interviews and household surveys. Results show that 33.1\% of forest cover was lost over a 16-year-period across the region. However, two forestry case study communities lost 7.2\% and 15.1\% of forest cover, while two adjacent non-forestry communities lost 86.5\% and 92.4\%, respectively.

This research aims to determine the viability of increasing the annual growth rate of Mexican avocado exports to the Canadian market. To carry out the work, the avocado market between Mexico and Canada was represented in an econometric model and, with the results, a partial equilibrium analysis was carried out, simulating a 50\% annual increase in exports. The results show that an increase in the amount of Mexican avocado exported to the Canadian market that results in an average annual growth rate of 50\% is viable in terms of income. The simulation shows that the Benefit/Cost Ratio (B/C R) in avocado production for the states of Jalisco, Michoacan and the State of Mexico, in the hypothetical scenario, would be 1.4831, 1.4257 and 1.5322 respectively.},
